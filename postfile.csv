I hear lots of Honda and Toyota owners say they won't buy a D3 car ever again, but, I never hear a Honda or a Toyota owner saying they are going to go back to a D3.
My father was one of them, only bought Fords for over 30 years....then one Olds Omega (he felt the brakes were not safe).....then 2 Camry's, and that is all he would want after the first one.
After my experience with Toyota in the 80s I have been back in the D3 camp with the exception of one Mitsubishi. At the age I usually buy them I know the usual pitfalls and what it costs to fix them. Usually cheaper than foreign.

Well, most of this (mobile payments) is not quite what I would call free. I had to sign up for Zelle in order to receive some money that was coming to me. Otherwise it would have taken weeks and mounds of paperwork, long story on that.

In order to use Zelle, you have to have a bank account with one of the members of Zelle. I wound up opening an account with Chase just so I could receive the money.

2018 Hyundai Elantra Sport (mine), and 2013 Acura RDX AWD (wife's)"
33,September 26,graphicguy,"Frankly, I've had a lot of car brands in my stable......Honda/Acura, BMW, Ford, GM (only ones I haven't owned are Oldsmobiles and GMCs), Chrysler (Dodge), Toyota, Datsun (never had any Nissans), Infiniti, Audi, VW (I'm counting my son's GTI), and probably a few clunkers I had when I was younger that I left on the side of the road with no plates.

Not pointing fingers at any owners here, as we like what we like. But for me, the Hondas/Acuras I've had in my stable have been by far the more reliable, least troublesome, easy to maintain vehicles I've ever owned. My son probably feels the same about his GTI. In his nearly 3 years of ownership, he's really had no issues. Have had a few Toyotas. Probably put them in this category, too.

In 2nd place is BMW. I chalk some of that up to their comprehensive (at the time) bumper-to-bumper, free maintenance warranties. And, the fact that even out of warranty, they weren't troublesome (although they were expensive to maintain out of warranty).

All the rest are below those above. Would I buy another GM? Maybe....it just wouldn't be a Cadillac. Right now, the only thing the General makes that has me mildly interested would be the Chevy Bolt/Volt. Nothing else in the lineup really floats my boat. Maybe a Corvette, but I'd probably look at a '60s version of one of those over a new one, and it would have to be a 'vert.

Wouldn't mind another BMW. They've really accelerated their pricing since I last had one (2011), though.

Used to be mildly interested in Mercedes, but they have the same pricing disease as BMW. I just read they have moved their entry level car (CLA) up a notch and it will now start to hit $50K. I didn't like it the last I drove one last year. I'll like it a whole lot less at $50K. And, the one I would be interested in, the C Class, will exceed $60K the way I like them. Just a few years ago, you could get a nice E Class for that kind of money. Now? Not interested!

May look at a Jag in the next few years if/when I decide to trade. But, as of right now, well into my 2nd year of ownership, I really still like my TLX. It just does everything well and has caused me zero problems. I've only changed the oil once and rotated the tires. Will probably have to do both again in the next month or two. That's it. And, even though the first service was free, I expect the 2nd one to cost well under $75 (with a coupon). Can't beat that.

As of today, CLA still bases at 33K, C at 40, E at 52. Upcoming A sedan will maybe change things a little. But for all of these (and their BMW counterparts), add 10K or so in options to have it the way most would want it. That's the German fun, everything is optional, and it has always been that way. You can already option up a CLA well into the 40s and a C past 60K, and those aren't AMG models. 50 years ago people joked that MB would charge you extra for the engine oil on a new car. Options carry high profit margins.

Any stats derived from self reporting data will have a sizable bias error due to many factors. My experience is that owners of certain makes are more forgiving of faults then those of other makes. It may be more of a herd mentality in effect. It may be that the Malibu owner is not indulged with how incredibly reliable there car is while the Accord owner is. The Accord owner in that situation may go with the perception while the Malibu owner may not.

A case in point someone I know who is a Toyota fanboy told me I should get a more reliable car like his when I got rid of my Elantra. However in almost 200k miles outside of normal maintenance that car cost me nothing in repairs and was on the shop only once. That was in contrast to his being in the shop multiple times costing him a couple of grand which was not routine maintenance in 100k miles. Yet in his minds eye his car was trouble free and I had issues with mine.

The Accord owner in that situation may go with the perception while the Malibu owner may not.
The sample for truedelta is strictly from folks who found out about the site when it was starting up. So these were folks who to my knowledge were likely already internet users. I suspect many Malibu owners of Gen 8 and 9 are older than average buyers. Many have had no or trivial problems, my assumption, and aren't interested in posting on the web on forums to pat themselves on the back for having been smart enough to have purchased a Malibu.

The reason there is a paucity of years reported on the Malibu is that truedelta must not have received enough information on owners who had registered their vehicles to have a reliable bit of info. They did not have leSabre 2003 in their data either, even though I had registered mine and had submitted reports by filling out the simple form they emailed every quarter IIRC.

Many Accord/Civic owners have a personal connection with their vehicle and in their self image to their car being a reliable vehicle. They are average age younger and may have been involved with reading Road and Track, or other mags that are performance oriented, or came across the truedelta soliciting for users to sign up and report. So there's a skew in demographics as well as in motivation.

The sample for truedelta is a convenience sample rather than a random sample such as JD Powers gets by mailing to each randomly selected owner of a registered or titled vehicle. A convenience sample is taking whatever you can find the way of polling.

But it does help bring out the lack of consistency in people's methods for evaluating vehicles.

E.g., my Malibu had one visit for a recall and that was for a software change. My Bu has 18-inch wheels, while there are 16, 17, and 19 also IIRC. The software was not programmed correctly to handle the parking/emergency brake being applied. That somehow caused a service vehicle light. Everything worked. Just set a light.

All other visits were maintenance except for a question about the double click trunk release that Chevrolet would install, so two spaced pushes on the remote were needed to unlock the trunk.

Any stats derived from self reporting data will have a sizable bias error due to many factors. My experience is that owners of certain makes are more forgiving of faults then those of other makes. It may be more of a herd mentality in effect. It may be that the Malibu owner is not indulged with how incredibly reliable there car is while the Accord owner is. The Accord owner in that situation may go with the perception while the Malibu owner may not.

A case in point someone I know who is a Toyota fanboy told me I should get a more reliable car like his when I got rid of my Elantra. However in almost 200k miles outside of normal maintenance that car cost me nothing in repairs and was on the shop only once. That was in contrast to his being in the shop multiple times costing him a couple of grand which was not routine maintenance in 100k miles. Yet in his minds eye his car was trouble free and I had issues with mine.

That is absolutely true. If say you look at CU about Tesla, you will find a wide discrepancy between reliability and ""customer satisfaction"". Apparently, Tesla owners are satisfied with unreliability. Go figure.

The sample for truedelta is strictly from folks who found out about the site when it was starting up. So these were folks who to my knowledge were likely already internet users. I suspect many Malibu owners of Gen 8 and 9 are older than average buyers. Many have had no or trivial problems, my assumption, and aren't interested in posting on the web on forums to pat themselves on the back for having been smart enough to have purchased a Malibu.

The reason there is a paucity of years reported on the Malibu is that truedelta must not have received enough information on owners who had registered their vehicles to have a reliable bit of info. They did not have leSabre 2003 in their data either, even though I had registered mine and had submitted reports by filling out the simple form they emailed every quarter IIRC.

Many Accord/Civic owners have a personal connection with their vehicle and in their self image to their car being a reliable vehicle. They are average age younger and may have been involved with reading Road and Track, or other mags that are performance oriented, or came across the truedelta soliciting for users to sign up and report. So there's a skew in demographics as well as in motivation.

The sample for truedelta is a convenience sample rather than a random sample such as JD Powers gets by mailing to each randomly selected owner of a registered or titled vehicle. A convenience sample is taking whatever you can find the way of polling. Such as doing a poll at the entrances to the local Kroger store at 10-2 on a weekday, when more women are shopping and their children are in school. Responses on whether the community should build a YMCA in the middle might be skewed.

Be that as it may, it seems that even with a flawed sample, the results are massively critical. True Delta would have had to require that every Tesla owner who registers has to swear he hates the car before posting.

In my car, the TPM not only shows psi for each tire, but also temperature of each tire.  I wonder why the manufacturer decided to include Fahrenheit temps in the TPM system?  Any thoughts?

I have a thought. They give you the tire pressure and the temperature reading so you have a better idea of what the pressure should be. The higher the temperature, the higher the air pressure reading....so it will give you a more accurate picture of why you are getting the reading you got.

Now, if you had rear air vents, the tire temperature would be lower, but, that is something we won't get into at this time.

Basically, @stickguy is correct, but backwards, depending on how you look at it.

The first really cool morning in the fall, I will have a ""low air pressure"" warning on the dash of one or both of my vehicles. Colder weather, the air in the tires is more ""condensed"" -- is that the word I want? The air molecules contain less energy, they are closer together, the air pressure in the tire goes down. So when the first cold front arrives, you will need to air up all of the tires on all of your vehicles.

105,September 25,abacomike,"
No, houdini, not really.  If you lease a car or have a loan on a car, the lessor or mortgagor requires that they be listed on the policy as an “additional insured”.  That means they may be entitled to proceeds from an insurance payout.  As an example, if I had an accident that totaled my car, the check from my insurance company would list my lessor or bank and me as “payee” which requires us both to endorse the check(s).  My bank or the lessor would not endorse the check unless they receive payment for the balance of the lease or their financial interest in the car.

Being listed as an “additional interest” on my Conco Policy only means that the insurance company is required to deliver a copy of my insurance policy with declarations page to my Condo Association to show proof of insurance as well as minimum limits of liability.  The Association has no claim on my insurance, just the right to receive copies of policies an/or be notified if I cancel or change my policy.

Jmonroe1.........this article explains the difference between having a vent to cool brakes....and not having a vent;

3? Brake Duct vs. “No Duct” Test at Singular Motorsports

I recently ran our 3” version vs. no ducting at the track (taped over the duct inlet on one side of the car). Following a brief half-session, and after a cool down lap which allowed temps to come down and stabilize a bit, on the non-ducted side we saw caliper temps of 585 degrees F. For those of you keeping score, that’s just a breath away from the boiling point of the Motul RBF600.

On the ducted side of the car, the caliper was 445 degrees F. Perfectly happy.
I had intended to do more testing with the side that was blocked off, but after seeing those temps I aborted that plan and kept both sides ducted the rest of the day. I literally would not run my car without these.

Effect of vents on brakes

I never said you couldn't get cooling via passing air over the calipers. Why don't you remember that this discussion started with what you thought could be a vent on the rear side of the Camry near the leading edge of tail/brake light assembly?

Give me a little credit for knowing that cooling the brakes via directing air over them is helpful in stopping a car. I don't think anyone in here wants to hear anymore about this so I'm now going to shut up. If you're afraid your post count will take a hit because of this keep posting but don't expect me to continue replying. I'm done with this subject.

IIRC, you thought rear vents were for decoration purposes only....that they had no useful purpose. I tried to show they direct the airflow from the wheel wells.....to minimize drag, and also to cool the brakes. That is all I said....it seems you begged to differ.

In other cars the rear vent is usually covered up, but the vent is still there at the back. See the Mclaren P1 (Notice that you can see mechanical bits through the rear grill; it is NOT for show! Air passes through it):

Does the condo association have a policy for the facility (e.g., common areas, grounds, etc?) as well? To me, it makes sense if all owners share a similar ""interest"" in that policy in the event they, or their property, is affected by something that happens under that umbrella.

Yes - the building and the “village” as well as the Association have insurance policies to cover loss, liability, etc.

My own policy covers my unit and all attached property such as toilet fixtures, vanities, kitchen cabins, etc. from the inside walls to the rest of the unit..  So I have $50,000 in coverage since the building’s insurance covers walls and support structures.  I also have contents (replacement cost) at $30,000 in coverage and $10,000 for additional living expenses.  $300,000 liability.  I also carry a 1 million dollar liability umbrella policy.

I am sure oldfarmer is going to put duct tape on his vents and try to see if it makes his car faster and brake better. Regular cars probably don't benefit from having vents, but, if you are driving fast then it could make a difference...it does in racing cars. Spoilers probably don't do much for most people, but, people think they are attractive since they are associated with speed.

The vents do serve a purpose on some cars and that is the reason they are on the car. No use adding vents if - even phony ones, if they didn't have anything to do with the car. How much do these vents and spoiler help dissipate air pressure and brake heat?

Maybe your point is they don't actually lessen air pressure or heat. My point is they probably don't do those things for average cars, but, that is why they appear on cars...probably more decorative than useful at speeds under 100 m.p.h.

Years ago one of the news shows (20/20 maybe) did a piece on car security systems. They parked cars in a known high crime area. Some had stickers without an alarm, some had an alarm without stickers. The cars without the sticker got broken into/stolen the ones with the sticker were untouched.

3? Brake Duct vs. “No Duct” Test at Singular Motorsports

I recently ran our 3” version vs. no ducting at the track (taped over the duct inlet on one side of the car). Following a brief half-session, and after a cool down lap which allowed temps to come down and stabilize a bit, on the non-ducted side we saw caliper temps of 585 degrees F. For those of you keeping score, that’s just a breath away from the boiling point of the Motul RBF600.

On the ducted side of the car, the caliper was 445 degrees F. Perfectly happy.
I had intended to do more testing with the side that was blocked off, but after seeing those temps I aborted that plan and kept both sides ducted the rest of the day. I literally would not run my car without these.

I just received a notice via email that my Condominium Association is voting next week to eliminate the requirement that all Condo Units maintain a ""land-line phone"" for security and fire. I found out that security will accept a cell phone with a passcode, which I already have. I just have to register the cell phone number with the security office. That will save me $45.00 a month and reduce the number of ""robo-calls"" I receive each week by 90%.

Another vote will be taken on requiring all Condo Unit Owners to list the Condominium Association as an additional insured on our Condominium Insurance for liability as well as loss. From what I understand, if there is a fire in a Condo and it spreads, causing physical damage to the building, the Association wants to make sure it has recourse to have the damage repaired by the Condo Unit Owner. Anyone know more about whether or not this is appropriate. I carry $300,000 liability insurance as well as a $1,000,000 umbrella policy.

My favorite part was when a 1990 former Air Force Humvee ( the actual military version) was auctioned off as a charity event to feed homeless vets. It had been highly customized and as it pulled up on the stage a trio of voluptuous women in WW2 WAC uniforms (The American Bombshells) piled out and gave an impromptu rendition of God Bless the USA.

They were hoping for $100k but the bidding stalled at $53k. Everyone was disappointed for the charity until one bidder stood up and donated $5,000 directly to the charity. Then another donated $5,000 and soon dozens of people were on their feet pledging between $1-5 thousand. I'm guessing the charity exceeded it's $100k goal by about 50 thousand.



We also got to hang out with Robbie Wolfe, the brother of one of the American Pickers and the person they call when they find cars. He says he has about a dozen cars in his collection and now is into collecting antique trucks. Very knowledgeable about what it costs to restore old cars. His opinion is that it's cheaper to just buy what you want at an auction rather than spend more doing it yourself. Evidently most cars cost more to restore than they bring at sale.

My land line through Verizon has been out of service since Wednesday with an estimated repair date of next week. Even then they can't be sure that when they fix a large cable it will restore service. They said if it doesn't come back by that date call us and we'll check you home line.

I think Verizon is letting it's copper wire system fall apart. They want you to sign up for FIOS so they can sell you internet too and poor service is their way of encouraging you.

As to the insurance thing, I think a lot of places want to be named as additional insured to reduce their own insurance cost at your expense. It's akin to you making every other driver buy uninsured motorist coverage in case you got hit by one.

I will try to say this as s-l-o-w-l-y as possible.

259,September 22,driver100,"They should be called vents, not louvers, my mistake. But, this from Bimmer link explains. They mostly, are used to move air out of wheel wells to reduce drag, but, a second benefit is to help cool heat build up around the brakes (funny, official site spells braking as breaking).

What is the purpose of fender vents?
The main purpose of fender vents is to relieve built-up air pressure from inside the wheel arches which causes aerodynamic lift. Typically, there are air intake openings in the front of the bumper directing air over the brakes to cool them. This air gets trapped in the wheel arches and creates high pressure resulting in lift over the front wheels reducing traction. Relieving this built up high-pressure system in the wheel arches reduces front axle lift thus increasing safety.

Trapped air in the wheel arches also creates aerodynamic drag. Drag is the force of air pushing in the opposite direction of the vehicle, reducing efficiency. Some research suggests wheel arches account for up to 30% of aerodynamic drag of a vehicle. With fuel efficiency ratings becoming increasingly more strict on modern vehicles you can understand why so much attention is being directed towards the reduction of this inefficiency. Efficiently routing air into and out of the wheel arches increases fuel economy through the reduction of drag.

Another benefit of fender vents is to efficiently vent hot air generated by heavy breaking out in the air stream. Quickly relieving hot air generated from the brakes makes room for more cool air to pass over the brakes, thus increasing efficiency. Finally, it is worth mentioning that trapped air in the wheel arches also contributes to cabin noise. Reduction of cabin noise is more pleasant to drivers on long trips reduces driver fatigue.

I used bimmertips because it was first on the list...others said the same.
WHY HAVE VENTS IN FRONT AND REAR FENDERS?

260,September 22,snakeweasel,"
Seems logical to me, having vents at the back allow for air to flow through the wheel well more efficiently allowing more air to flow over the brakes for more efficient cooling. It would also reduce drag.

I'll just pass on what the experts say:

The rotating wheels effect air. The wheel well vents control this air flow.
Tremendous heat is developed in the ceramic - carbon braking systems to slow F1 cars. The vents provide cooling to the braking systems.
Most important the well vents along with the vents on the brake hubs are manipulated to control tire temperature which has significant effects on car performance. By changing the hub vents (varying the degree they are open) they can control the heat distribution in the brakes, rims and tires more uniformly.

Many vents today are decorative....but, it is a symbol for the reason they were first developed.....to keep pressure from building up in wheel wells, and to cool brakes.

I owe everything to my Primary Care Physician who, because of his diligence in screening me for liver problems due to my Hepatitis C viral infection, discovered a lesion in my liver after a routine 6 month ultrasound. After many tests and a biopsy, I was referred to the liver transplant team at Broward Medical Center and underwent a liver resection which ended up removing 3 malignant tumors. Those doctors and nurses are also the reason I am still alive.

My doctor continues to test for liver cancer with ultrasounds twice a year and a PET Scan once a year because this type of aggressive liver cancer has a tendency to re-establish itself in the liver. In other words, once you've had it, there's a good chance it can return. Thank God the Hepatitis C is no longer rampant in my body thanks to that new anti viral med, Epclusa.

I will admit that I have not really felt well since that liver resection. I have become overly tired, sluggish, and insomnia has become a big problem, even with strong sleeping pills. But at least I am alive and can watch my grandchildren grow up and become strong men and one of them a great athlete. Can't wait to see what they eventually become of themselves.

Have you asked your doctor if your symptoms are typical for liver transplant recipients? Maybe joining a gym would provide some greater strength and endurance, in addition to the walking you do? Is it an effect of the meds you have to take for other conditions? It would be nice if you could feel a little more peppy!

289,September 22,tjc78,"I just helped my SIL pick up a 2016 Yaris Hatchback. She had been limping along her 2000ish Corrolla and it finally gave up the ghost (Head gasket, two bad tires, front and rear brakes). Car had nearly 200K. Her neighbor gave $450 for it and is going to work on it himself and flip it. Good luck.

She had a little money saved but not enough for anything decent. My wife and I helped her form a budget for $300 / month with insurance.

She is only 22 and has a 600 credit score. So... high interest rate but we got it done. Car was an ex rental (I know) in decent shape for 9,000. Her first new car and she managed to get approved all on her own. With a limited budget she didn’t have many choices.

Price appeared fair (maybe a touch high but was a no-haggle place) and the dealer was straight up with nothing hidden. She hopes to knock out the loan in two years paying a little extra and dumping a good chunk of her income tax refund on it.

She wanted to buy out my Elantra’s lease but when I looked it up the buyout was $15,600 and that was not only too high for the car, but also out of her price range. Kind of a shame, because that would have meant new car shopping for me!! No doubt the Elantra is going to be around the whole lease. Hopelessly buried in that thing.

My problem with the new Camry is that it went the Avalon route with a low platform to get in and out and a low headroom environment. But that really is a matter of an individual's physical and personal preferences. A maintained Camry will go many, many years without a ton of problems or maintenance requirements. The step up to an ES seems to be mostly a matter of a bit nicer interior and a quieter environment, but the Camry isn't a slouch here either. However, I still the think the Camry and ES are, shall we just say, not likely to be considered classic styling a decade or so out."

297,September 21,abacomike,"
jwm, let me put it another way:

If a dealer makes a “decision” to charge a dealer fee, it must be charged to ALL BUYERS of cars/trucks/SUV’s equally, without exception, per state statute/law.  Proof of this charge being nondiscrimatory is the fact that the “fee” is preprinted on the dealership’s buyer’s order and bill of sale for “every” transaction.  

The very top line on a bill of sale is a figure known as the “selling price.”  That figure is not the MSRP, but rather the agreed price of that vehicle’s sale price.  That number can be reduced by the amount of the “fee” in order to circumvent legal problems associated with the statute requiring that all sales must include the “fee” as required by the State in which a dealer fee is charged.  The State does not require a dealer fee - just that if a dealer fee is charged, every customer must be charged the same amount at the point of sale.

Thus, when I buy/lease a car from a dealership and refuse to pay the dealer fee, all they do is reduce the “selling price” by the amount of the dealer fee.  Then, it (amount of dealer fee) is added back at the bottom of the bill of sale - just playing with numbers.  The net affect is that I did not pay the fee as it was backed out of the selling price.

That’s how it is done.

Florida does require that if a fee is charged, it “must “ be charged to everyone.  I tried looking up the requirement, but since I am not an attorney, I did not know where to look.  It must be in The State of Florida Statutes or it could be a requirement of the State of Florida Commerce Department.  But I do remember sitting in a legal conference sponsored by the State on due diligence in meeting the requirements of that dealer fee issue back when I was a sales manager.

305,September 21,dino001,"I see lots of effort put by many companies into figuring out how to pay people less for the same effort, or if that's not possible, how to push the compensation on somebody else. Incentives always get ""restructured"" to give less, bonus plans always rise the threshold.

Whole tipping is turning into a sham - from what I heard, it used to be 10 percent, then 15 on value before tax, now they all want 20 on value with tax and in some places they'd still say it's not enough. What annoys me even more, I see now tip jars or some other kind of push in places you never saw it before. Panera Bread is trying to guilt you into tipping, when you make an order, take it yourself from the counter and return the dirty dishes to the station. I refuse, it should not be my responsibility to compensate the employee in any case, but in this one it seems outrageous. What's more, I bet if people start tipping in large numbers, Panera will simply reduce staff's compensation, as now they're tipped, so why they need to pay them. Then I'll be a bad guy for not tipping and denying an employee their rightful compensation. This whole thing is making me sick. Pay people right, figure out your price, say what it is, let me have my meal in peace, so I don't have to think of welfare of the guy who brought it to me. I just want my meal.

For example, he auto manufacturers pay Apple a fee to license Car Play. They all seem to be adopting the model of letting the phone OS do the work of their in-house developed OS for infotainment.

Probably makes sense. The cost of developing all that infrastructure internally is huge. Then, you have to pay to support it, which is probably even a higher cost.

Of course, Mike. It's good to know the fee value before, so you can prepare yourself to lower the ""price"" accordingly, if you're talking in that particular format.

My beef is mostly with the truth in advertising, not whether price is too high, too low, or if they ""deserve"" their ""money for nothing"" fee. You open newspaper with a screaming ""starting at"", ""you pay"", or whatever and you have to make all that math. I think it crossed the line where it's no longer just a ""format"", it's a clear lie. Screaming ""you pay"", then you need to add $3000 in trade (you still pay it, just in a different form, i.e. barter), $1000 in fee, sometimes another $1000 in manufacturer's destination, as it was excluded from ""you pay"" shout, THEN of course add all the taxes and registration. At some point it becomes ridiculous and completely useless.

Airlines used to do that, too (Fly New York from $59, one way fare based on round trip, taxes, fees not included), but they were finally prohibited. Today they have to advertise OTD price, they might be allowed break it into one-way I believe, but that's it. It's time similar laws are passed for the car industry, as it clearly has no interest in clearing itself from all that BS, if anything it keeps ratcheting it up. It may be a bit harder, but I still think they can manage - it's not that hard to add all the fees and even state government taxes and registration fees, based on a common scenario prescribed by the legislator, e.g. taxes, title and 1 year registration at jurisdiction specific to the dealer with disclaimer that people outside of the county may pay more or less. Same thing can be done with lease or loan payments - clearly stated jurisdiction, interest rate, down payment and other assumptions. But wait... people would be shocked cars are so expensive. People can't know how much they are actually paying. They'd stay home and the economy would collapse. We can't have that - deception is the only way to keep the economy rolling.
Doc fees seem to be one of the most disliked dealer add ons that a knowledgeable car buyer faces at time of purchase. Note that I said ""knowledgeable car buyer"" because most car buyers don't even know about this and just pay it. For the guys in here we account for it in our offer.

When I bought my '15 Genny it was from a dealer in Fairfax Virginia. I went there because this was the only dealer I could find (really found by Son #1) that had the car I wanted. A V8 in the exact color I wanted both exterior and interior, or so I thought at the time but that is another story I have since griped about but what is done is done so I have to live with that. I did my negotiating via phone calls after the initial internet visit which prompted the salesman to call. We had the typical back and forth negotiating via calls and as the salesman was off getting approval of the final number we agreed on, I noticed that the dealers internet page mentioned all prices did not include sales tax, plate fees, AND a doc fee of almost $600 (I think it was $580). Needless to say I missed that before but now that I knew it that got a rise out of me. I immediately called the salesman to tell him not to bother getting approval because we were not going to get to a deal now because of the high doc fee. He did the typical dealer song and dance about having to charge everybody that fee because it was preprinted on their sales document and it was a policy that could not be changed. I told him I understood it was their policy but my policy was not to pay an exorbitant doc fee. I also told him I didn't like them at all but at least in PA the doc fee was a more reasonable $138 (it is now $144) and the last time I bought a car in PA, I backed out the doc fee from the price of the car that the dealer wanted to allow for it. Just as I'm about to hang up I said something like, ""I understand your position so I'll just call the dealer in Akron who has my second color choice (which should have been my first choice. Yes, I'm still griping about the color) and buy from him. Still hung up about wanting my first color choice I said, ""I'll tell you what, since you have the color I want, if you drop your doc fee to $138 I'll buy your car but I doubt your boss will agree to this deal but if you want to try it I'll wait before calling the dealer in Akron. He said he'd get back to me within a half hour to let me know so ""please don't do anything until I get back to you"". I agreed. He calls back in 15 minutes and says we have a deal but the sales contract will still say $580. They will adjust the price of their car and show more for my trade ('09 Genny), however, they still have to decide how to break that up but he assures me the bottom line will be what we agreed to as the final price. I asked for and received an email confirming this. So they can do it when they want to and obviously they wanted to.

I pass this info on not so much to show that a dealer can do a reasonable deal when they want to but to point out to you guys, and once again remind myself, that as much as we THINK we know how to do a deal based on our research, we don't really know how much trunk money there is to play with. We only THINK we know. In the end, as long as the dealer meets our number (assuming we know something), we have nothing to complain about.

336,September 21,jwm40517,"I just do not get the doc fee argument from dealers who say they have to charge the same amount to all buyers or be accused of discrimination. Why is the doc fee so sacred? Every other part of the deal from car price to interest rate, add-ons, extended service agreements and more varies from one deal to another and no 2 deals out of 100 are the same. If you apply the doc fee argument to every sale, every buyer would pay the same price."

Regarding doc fees.....I've heard the dealer say they HAVE TO charge the doc fee to me because if they didn't, they could be sued for discrimination since they charge everyone else that fee.

My answer is always the same....""I don't care how you show the deal on paper. My offer stands. It's on number. Divide that number on paper however you want.""
I have heard dealers quote that too. I always ask them if they don't sell all their cars at the same price, throw in floor mats for one customer, or charge a higher interest rate, aren't they afraid of being sued for discrimination?"

Not really a surprise to me. When your all-new car looks like a 9/10s scale copy of the previous edition and prospective customers cannot tell them apart then you have made a serious error. Add to that the ridiculously poor visibility, unattractive dash design, poor space utilization and stiff pricing and you have a problem. I absolutely fail to understand what GM was thinking with this car's development.

I think you hit it. By increasing the doc fees, dealers are trying to ""lock in"" more and more profit to themselves rather than sharing it with the employees. They think they are giving ""motivation"" to their workforce to hunt for the extra money from their customers. However, in current internet pricing era, we've reaching the point, where it doesn't work anymore. With knowledge on the ""nominal spread"" and faced with steep $1000 fee, customer who knows enough will simply refuse any decent markup, pay only X amount and you figure it out how you write it. The salesperson gets a mini anyway. Then why bother at all? A rational reaction would be to focus on volume, not price.

356,September 21,stickguy,"part of the problem might be that the compensation model no longer makes sense with the way pricing is done now. So it would be a lot easier to just move to a non-commission pay model. Basically a salary + bonus per unit? There are some dealers around here that advertise non-commissioned sales people. Probably like a waiter, the base would not be that high, but they would get a couple hundred maybe per unit. so there is still incentive to sell more.

sales people don't really care that much about the price I don't think, since most deals are minis anyway. So they sort of are on a volume pay plan.

seems counterproductive for dealers to work this hard to screw their employees, which mostly leads to constant turn over. Guess making it a better customer experience is not relevant to them.

Old school thinking. The old “I’ll control the sales process”. If control is what you want, roll into the showroom with a wad of Benjamins and yell to anyone who will listen “who wants to sell me a car?”.

You want to waste time? Keep trying to work towards controlling instead of getting the car you want at the deal you want.

I’ve said this time and again, if you walk into the dealership thinking you’re going to grind, you’ll lose.

1. You don’t know the price you’re going to pay before you walk in the door because you’re focused on grinding that last $50 instead of what you’ll be spending overall

2. What you save on the front end, you’ll give away on the back end.

For the last 15-20 years, I figure out what the car is worth and what it can be sold for. I add in my “pre-figured” tax, title and license fees. And, then present that number to the sales person/manager. They can either accept it or reject it. If they reject it, I move on. If they accept it, I just bought a car.

They get ONE NUMBER. I don’t care what their doc fee is. I don’t care what addies they may try to charge for. There’s no bumping for extraneous fees in F&I. The number is the number.

Negotions are easy. No stress. I’m happy with the deal (since I penciled it) and the dealer is happy with the deal (since they accepted it). It’s quick, too.
I work from a similar standpoint. I usually get my numbers off TrueCar, add 6.25% sales tax, and $300 for license plates, doc fees, etc. That is the number, take it or leave it, thank you very much.

The last new truck I bought actually wound up lower than TrueCar. The dealership had an online sales price which was several hundred lower than TrueCar. When I came in, they wanted to add about $1,000 for “dealer add ons” (wheel locks, door edge guards, etc). I politely declined, said, “I will pay your advertised price, plus 6.25%, plus $300. End of story.” After a few minutes of hedging around, they agreed, the deal was made.

They had done one thing which I had not seen before. For all of their vehicles, they took the window sticker and laminated it, along with an extra piece with the dealer add ons, all laminated together to look like one document. I guess they think this will make the add ons look more “official”.


That works for me. I'll usually look at TrueCar. Look at their online ads. Nose around their lot after hours to see what their stock situation is (that tells me if they have a little or a lot of what I'm looking at).

I don't care how they divy up my number either. Not so much any more, but I used to hear the dealers say that their ""doc fee"" was required by law. Every time I asked them which law they could point me to outlining that fee, they backed off.

I don't even argue with them any more. I make the one offer. That's it.

The “law” is stated: “If you charge a dealer fee, it must be pre-printed on all buyer’s orders and bills of sales and charged to ALL buyers.”  There are no State laws that require dealer fees.

The way a dealer can bypass that fee is to lower the selling price by the amount of the fee.

Not to be argumentative, but I have never been able to find a law that says that. I understand the dealers are protecting themselves from being labeled as discriminatory if they don't charge everyone since, evidently, there have been lawsuits about it.

Of course, Mike. It's good to know the fee value before, so you can prepare yourself to lower the ""price"" accordingly, if you're talking in that particular format.

My beef is mostly with the truth in advertising, not whether price is too high, too low, or if they ""deserve"" their ""money for nothing"" fee. You open newspaper with a screaming ""starting at"", ""you pay"", or whatever and you have to make all that math. I think it crossed the line where it's no longer just a ""format"", it's a clear lie. Screaming ""you pay"", then you need to add $3000 in trade (you still pay it, just in a different form, i.e. barter), $1000 in fee, sometimes another $1000 in manufacturer's destination, as it was excluded from ""you pay"" shout, THEN of course add all the taxes and registration. At some point it becomes ridiculous and completely useless.

Airlines used to do that, too (Fly New York from $59, one way fare based on round trip, taxes, fees not included), but they were finally prohibited. Today they have to advertise OTD price, they might be allowed break it into one-way I believe, but that's it. It's time similar laws are passed for the car industry, as it clearly has no interest in clearing itself from all that BS, if anything it keeps ratcheting it up. It may be a bit harder, but I still think they can manage - it's not that hard to add all the fees and even state government taxes and registration fees, based on a common scenario prescribed by the legislator, e.g. taxes, title and 1 year registration at jurisdiction specific to the dealer with disclaimer that people outside of the county may pay more or less. Same thing can be done with lease or loan payments - clearly stated jurisdiction, interest rate, down payment and other assumptions. But wait... people would be shocked cars are so expensive. People can't know how much they are actually paying. They'd stay home and the economy would collapse. We can't have that - deception is the only way to keep the economy rolling.

They had done one thing which I had not seen before. For all of their vehicles, they took the window sticker and laminated it, along with an extra piece with the dealer add ons, all laminated together to look like one document. I guess they think this will make the add ons look more “official”.
I'm sure they didn't take the sticker off the car (I think this would be illegal, stickers are supposed to be put in the distribution center/port and stay glued to the car until sold), but they could have developed a process of laminating if from the outsider with that junk sticker. The regulars here know that Southeastern Toyota (and Gulf, too IIRC) has a ""better"" way, i.e. even more obnoxious. Since they control the distribution, they put the add-on stuff there, so the sticker really is official. I'm sure they share the profit with the dealers, or you'd hear them complaining about it to the media.

The SET stickers can sometimes add as much as a grand of that valuable stuff. Then you of course have a ""customary"" fee, already crossed $1000 at those megadealers ($600 are now ""low fee"" dealers). So, the starting position is around two grand markup for a can of this, can of that, pimply teenagers spraying it (or not), some paperwork, sometimes first oil change.

I work from a similar standpoint. I usually get my numbers off TrueCar, add 6.25% sales tax, and $300 for license plates, doc fees, etc. That is the number, take it or leave it, thank you very much.

The last new truck I bought actually wound up lower than TrueCar. The dealership had an online sales price which was several hundred lower than TrueCar. When I came in, they wanted to add about $1,000 for “dealer add ons” (wheel locks, door edge guards, etc). I politely declined, said, “I will pay your advertised price, plus 6.25%, plus $300. End of story.” After a few minutes of hedging around, they agreed, the deal was made.

They had done one thing which I had not seen before. For all of their vehicles, they took the window sticker and laminated it, along with an extra piece with the dealer add ons, all laminated together to look like one document. I guess they think this will make the add ons look more “official”.
That works for me. I'll usually look at TrueCar. Look at their online ads. Nose around their lot after hours to see what their stock situation is (that tells me if they have a little or a lot of what I'm looking at).

I don't care how they divy up my number either. Not so much any more, but I used to hear the dealers say that their ""doc fee"" was required by law. Every time I asked them which law they could point me to outlining that fee, they backed off.

I don't even argue with them any more. I make the one offer. That's it.

I don't know about the law, but the window stickers had been removed, laminated (with the additions), and set back inside the vehicles. That was true on several vehicles I looked at, at that particular dealer.

Unfortunately we have no such laws up here. Some dealers don't mind the stickers and leave them on, but many have the lot attendants remove them. You will often see them on the back seat or rear floor. Sometimes you can still read them, sometimes not. Usually they are destroyed before delivery.

So the only way for them to do it is lawfully, if the sticker was generated at port/distribution center (when the vehicle is technically still in the possession of the manufacturer or his agent), or the lamination on the outside. Removal by anybody else than the owner is against the law. Kind of like that mattress sticker. If what you say is happening and they get removed before the customer signs papers, somebody should call the state AG.

The'd take it off at the time of prep. At this point you presumably signed your papers, the car is your and they have your implied permission to take it off, as you obviously don't want to drive with it. They hand it to you, so by law ""you"" took it off and they were just your agent at that point. (you got your dealer's fee worth ).

Demo is different - most of the time it's a used car, already titled. Sometimes not, but then it's a bit tricky. There may be some exemptions for that, as it's covered by the manufacturer's. Never bought one, so I don't know. Not even sure how the original warranty works on an untitled demo with 5K miles on it. I don't think they can print replacements at the dealerships. The Monroney sticker law was aimed to prevent exactly that, as in the past dealers would do all kinds of shenanigans, making consumers think the MSRP was different.

Great responses. To sell, you have to find out if there are objections....and then have an answer that solves it.
Another thing is to try to ask a question that has to be answered with more than a 'NO"". For example, rather than asking can I help you today, ask, is there a particular model you are looking for? NO, ends the conversation, a good question opens up the possibility of a conversation.

It seems some salespeople think they can tell if someone is a serious buyer.

A few years ago I went to look at the previous model Ford Fusion. A former friend of mine was selling Fords so that made it easy.

When I showed up at the dealership he had one of the assistants they had there take me out in his demo Fusion. It was a used car he was driving at the time. It said ""9 miles to empty"" on the gas gauge and the brakes were shot. You had to pump them to stop.

He just didn't seem interested so I left.

A year or so later he made a comment that I wasn't a serious buyer then. He couldn't have been more wrong. I bought a Buick Regal 2 days later.

It makes you wonder how often this happens and how many sales are lost because a salesperson is a know-it-all.

Why?  Because that is how sales are made, karhill.  Most customers are not as aggressive as you claim they are or should be.  Whenever I would greet an aggressive or cocky customer, I just relaxed and let him control things until I had developed a relationship.  Rather than fight him, i just relaxed.  If I felt I was being “run over” by a customer, I let him “run me over” until he satisfied himself that he was in total control.  That is the way to deal with aggressive buyers.  Provide answers to his questions and if the interactions became overwhelming, I just thanked him for coming in.

Obnoxious customers are different.  They not only want control, but are nasty and antagonistic.  Those are the ones I just let the sales manager handle when I sold cars.  When I was a sales manager, if they continued their “run me over” attitude, I just gave them the name of a competing dealership and showed them the door.

Everyone is a payment buyer, the question is how many payments are they going to make?
Not really. The real questions are how much do you want for the car, what's the cost of the money (if applicable) in a particular form of financing, and how much will you give me for my car, if I trade in. The payment will come out of that automatically and in places I have bought my cars the don't make ""math errors"" at F&I. If they did, that would be end of discussion. I could afford twice or now even thrice the payment that is appropriate for a vehicle and term I'm seeking (not that it would be a good idea), so discussion of $XX per month is completely irrelevant to me.

""Afford"" is never a question to me for the vehicles I'm buying - I figure that way before I come to a place, it's only how much do you will sell it for, so all that discussion on Youtube, while entertaining, makes no difference to me - other than any attempt like that would make me walk away after couple of minutes. I suspect though, really good salesman/closer would know that, so they'd keep things on target. Especially, considering that I'm not overly ""greedy"" on my expectations. I won't let them push me into excessive markups, but I don't need a ""deal of a Century"" to close, either. And ""per month"" screamer offers really annoy me, especially if they don't disclose enough pertinent details (which always is the case). I remember once a young Mazda guy (long time ago) insisted on them to pencil me an ""offer"", after I just wanted to test drive it. I had another 30 minutes to kill, so I said OK. Then he brings that magic XX/month for 60 months on some form. So I ask him what's the interest rate, ""I don't know"", show me components for this number, he stared at me like I just asked him to write a Shrodinger's equation. I knew that was it, so I thanked him for his time. He was still asking ""is the number OK?"", I was like ""I don't know enough to say"". I wasn't buying anyway, but the approach to business told me this was NOT the place I wanted to go, if actually shopped for Mazda.

I treated every person that walked into our showroom as a potential buyer in that I gave everyone the same amount of attention and respect. My second sale was to a couple that were ""just looking"" to replace their totaled E46 M3; they test drove an M240i and at the end of the test drive decided to buy it on the spot. What was really kind of funny was that the salesman who usually exceeded his targets every month had a couple coming in to look at the same car. They rolled up just after my NCM accepted my customers' offer. The other customers didn't have a deposit on the car so they only got a quick glance at it before I drove it to the detail bay...

A**holes are everywhere, customers, salespeople, managers. It's quite funny. I know the type - the world is out to get them, constantly unhappy, constantly smelling a conspiracy. However, I do keep my guard in places I described before (some of those ""popular"" brand dealership). Those places bring worst in people on both sides. They breed not only bad sales and managing staff, they also breed bad customers. Many people would become combative and nasty after experiencing enough of that stuff over there that they won't believe that other places can do business a different way. If you are a Honda buyer in Tampa Bay, for example, you simply have no choice but endure this boiler room environment, if you want to buy one. The curse with them is that the product is good enough for people to take that abuse - especially that stored of their direct competitor, Toyota, is not much better, or can be worse. Buy three-four Hondas or Toyotas that way and you believe everybody else is like that.

BTW, there were some other outfits in the area that were even worse, literally criminal. The most infamous was thank God defunct Bill Heards Chevrolet. You read stuff you can't even believe was possible. I only think those people who used to work in place like that - how they slept at night and looked at the mirror in the morning.

The single most important component of a solid buying strategy is for the buyer to assume control of the process. An essential part of assuming control is control of the discussion.
Old school thinking. The old “I’ll control the sales process”. If control is what you want, roll into the showroom with a wad of Benjamins and yell to anyone who will listen “who wants to sell me a car?”.

You want to waste time? Keep trying to work towards controlling instead of getting the car you want at the deal you want.

I’ve said this time and again, if you walk into the dealership thinking you’re going to grind, you’ll lose.

1. You don’t know the price you’re going to pay before you walk in the door because you’re focused on grinding that last $50 instead of what you’ll be spending overall

2. What you save on the front end, you’ll give away on the back end.

For the last 15-20 years, I figure out what the car is worth and what it can be sold for. I add in my “pre-figured” tax, title and license fees. And, then present that number to the sales person/manager. They can either accept it or reject it. If they reject it, I move on. If they accept it, I just bought a car.

They get ONE NUMBER. I don’t care what their doc fee is. I don’t care what addies they may try to charge for. There’s no bumping for extraneous fees in F&I. The number is the number.

Negotions are easy. No stress. I’m happy with the deal (since I penciled it) and the dealer is happy with the deal (since they accepted it). It’s quick, too.

437,September 20,snakeweasel,"
Well unless the dealership is giving away cars everyone is a payment buyer, even if it is just one payment. 

Personally I really don't care how they come up with the numbers, in the end all that matters is how the cash flows. If I want that new Sludgemobile LX and my research shows that $25K is a real good price and I will put down $5K and I can get a 48 month loan at 4% then I know my monthly payment would be $502.95 a month (presuming 8.5% sales tax and $150 for tags). Now if they come up with that monthly payment or less why should I care how they got it? It still meets or beats what I figured out was a good deal. If they give me the car for free charge me $6K in doc fees and charge me 363.5% interest for 48 months I'm still at the $502.95 a month.

438,September 20,dino001,"Today it really is much easier, as you can see the inventory on line, so you can figure out real price before walking in. It wasn't as easy years ago, you didn't know what they had and the range of prices is too large to come with ""one number"", unless you come with exact configuration in mind and you either hit it or not. Otherwise, you'd need some formula to figure it out on the spot.

I was fortunate not to run into too many ""buy today"" people. Probably because I stayed away from those places, but most likely they almost never had the configuration I wanted. My taste has always been ""off the mainstream"".

For example, last time I bought my 430, I came to a Volvo place, as I considered red V60 wagon, R-trim. But they don't have a single V60-R in stock, other dealers in the area may have couple in black or white. They have S60 sedan in the same engine trim. I ask them to show it to me and I want to test drive it. I'd mention multiple times during the test drive that I'm also considering 430, I would tell them what I like, what I don't and I still have things to look at. We talk enough details so they know I didn't come to joyride, I'm really looking into it, most likely an order. We may even mention pricing (their usual opening salvo is MSRP, or something like 1000 bucks off). I may discuss it further, or not, depends on my mood. There is no room for ""close today"" in this whole conversation no matter how much they may try and they know they'd likely lose the sale if they started the whole dance and push right now. We shake hands, I take the card and keep contact until decide. I'd do that in two-three dealerships per model, as there is always something new to learn about the car each time. Once I decide what, I take an offer from one dealer away, so I know I have somewhere to go and I go to the frontrunner. I strike the deal based on that offer with an extra concession, but nothing outrageous, they agree fairly quickly. It most likely leaves something on the table, but I don't care. I let the rest know it's over, I owe them that much.

So... just as an example, someone born in 1900 would add their age, 118, to their birth year and get 2018. Well...yes... because addition works. It also worked EVERY year. Same with someone born in 1954, who would turn 64 this year 1954+64=2018... but also in 1969 when they turned 15, 1954+15 =1969

It seems some salespeople think they can tell if someone is a serious buyer.

A few years ago I went to look at the previous model Ford Fusion. A former friend of mine was selling Fords so that made it easy.

When I showed up at the dealership he had one of the assistants they had there take me out in his demo Fusion. It was a used car he was driving at the time. It said ""9 miles to empty"" on the gas gauge and the brakes were shot. You had to pump them to stop.

He just didn't seem interested so I left.

A year or so later he made a comment that I wasn't a serious buyer then. He couldn't have been more wrong. I bought a Buick Regal 2 days later.

It makes you wonder how often this

One of the reasons I don't always listen to the reviewers is because different people desire different things. Sometimes a car just ""feels"" right even if it took a hit in the press for a poorly placed knob or lack of the latest electronic toy.

You should watch the Good Samaritan videos on YouTube--there are plenty of people who help others when they are helpless. It'll put you in a good mood! Works for me.

The point is the those three were presented in the descending order of their social standing in those times and Samaritans (third guy) were generally despised by Jews as low class intruder barbarians (sounds familiar?), so the point of the parable was even stronger, especially in an ancient society, where social standing was everything.

At the very beginning of this YouTube training presentation, what the trainer did was to identify objections to purchasing the car.  What he said was, “...if I understand you correctly, aside from the payment of $600 per month for 60 months, is there anything else keeping you from buying the car...?” or something very close to that.  What he is trying to do is teach the salesmen about identifying objections to buying the car and dealing with those objections.  He even mentioned to the buyer about having selected the right car.  This is intended to isolate the main objection to make sure you are dealing with the one reason keeping the salesman from closing the deal.  In this scenarios, the only objections to buying the car was the monthly payment.

Now the salesman will go over the selected vehicle and its features to see if an adjustment to the selected vehicle can be made, i.e., a model with less equipment in order to move the negotiations closer to a conclusion.  A car without LED lights might be enough to bring the cost down to $560 a month and even lower to close the deal.

That’s how I trained my salesmen at Infiniti - eliminate and/or identify all objections to making the sale.  If you don’t, you won’t make the sale.

1 Here’s the Keys- Drive It home and let her see it.

2 A credit card is fine or we have an internal draft you can sign until you bring in the check

3 I can take care of those remaining payments by buying the car from the leasing company

4 I have a car in stock exactly the way you want it equipped with leather seats “or” I can get that exact car by tomorrow morning 

5 No problem.  We have the car you want and I know we can price it right where you want to be.  How much did You want to pay?  $600 a month?  I know I can get it st that price or possibly less.

driver100 - have you not read this story before? 

A man was going down the road from the city of Jerusalem to Jericho. This man was a Jew. As he was walking along, robbers grabbed him. They knocked him down and took his money and his clothes. The robbers beat him up and left him half dead beside the road.
 A short time later, a priest came along that road. He saw the man who was badly hurt. What would you have done?— Well, the priest just went by on the opposite side of the road. He didn’t even stop. He didn’t do anything at all to help the man.
Did you catch the point, driver100? The priest didn't do anything to help the downed Jewish man. Now, you guys know me, I'm not going to get all religious on ya. But that old account from thousands of years ago totally describes what's happening now on the earth. Most people would rather spit on you than help you when you're down. For that poor Jewish man, he was already robbed and beaten. I'll bet that priest would gladly take your tithe on Sunday morning, yet he wouldn't stop and help a man beaten and left for dead on the side of the road. There's a huge moral story told by that one Bible account.

We've had State Farm for many, many decades. Never have had a problem. Roof damaged by hail that wasn't obvious from ground. Roof gypsies kept coming wanting to get on my roof. Told them ""No."" Called agent. Adjuster came. Photographer, Replaced roof on storage barn to match house (I had done the reroof on storage barn myself 10 years earlier). Paid for some damage to metal louvers on heat pump. Etc..

Wife lost one of 3 center diamonds from ring. Another was chipped (princess cut chips easily along the cleavage lines). Paid claim for that through local, trusted gemologist. Substantial claim.

Only complaint is I'm up to $1000 deductible and I don't like the agent who took over the office from the agent who retired. He's a sleazebag, IMHO. Thinks he's a late night entertainer personality. I don't know what he talked my son and fiancé into as insurance but I had warned my son before he went for the insurance checkup.

Life insurance through State Farm for myself. Policy has cash value which is paid in event of my death along with policy face amount. Agent tried to sell me another prepaid policy using the cash value. Commi$$ion territory. I warned my son that insurance agents are not financial advisors, no matter how they present themselves. They are not fiduciaries.

493,September 19,stickguy,"GG, depends on the plan, but if the annuity maxes out at age 60 then there is no reason not to start taking the benefit at that point. Won't get higher, so just giving money away. Taking it early is rarely a good idea (at a reduced benefit).

and I think leasing is the best way to make your negative equity disappear (I think Mike basically did this?). Can roll lots of messy stuff into the right lease, and you basically are financing your neg equity at a really low interest rate. You go from upside down to even in 3 years (when the lease ends, and you are back at square one). So leases are great for that, and people that know by the end of 3 years they are definitely getting a new car (and take good care of them and are sure their usage will be stable).

Also, not all car write-ups are written honestly. I don't believe about 80% of those reviews of the Sentra. They're rubbish!
Man, I think I would have to try to sell the Soul private party. Especially if you're upside down, you can probably double your trade value ($3,500-4,000 private sale?), then just pay off the difference out of pocket, which should be small enough at that point to be doable. You'll come out much farther ahead in the end versus trade in and rolling that negative equity into a new loan.

Thanks @stickguy ...exactly what I’m looking for. I do have some annuities getting ready to max out. My “plan” takes me to 62 when they all max out. With my other investments, I was planning on drawing down at 65. But, I also plan on working until 62, take a few years to use discretionary money to sell assets (like my house) and reinvest into smaller digs.

Seeing what you guys are leasing, and what you’re leasing, and considering I’ll never keep a car 10 years (let alone 5 years), I’m starting to get interested in leasing.

Athough, if there’s a car I would consider keeping for another several years, it would be my current Acura. It’s been a long time since I’ve liked a car this much. Not the sportiest, fastest, etc car I’ve ever owned. But, it sure is satisfying overall....especially for the price.

How's this for a complicated deal......my niece wants to buy her brother's 2017 Civic. Brother bought it in Maryland and rolled negative equity from his trade into the loan. Loan is from Maryland and in that state I understand the bank keeps the title. Indications are he owes $22k on a car worth maybe $16k. Niece has no credit history to speak of so her parents need to cosign. They have tier 1credit but are carrying a lot of debt.

I told them they might have to put in some cash but I'm not sure how much. Are credit unions loaning more than 100% on used cars these days?
Not sure how that works, especially since the banks tightened credit qualifications. But, some of the predatory lending practices have been reinstated. So, maybe very high, sub prime interest rates are now possible again.

Credit Unions are usually more strict in their lending policies. I don’t think they’d be a target to give lend money on a sub prime risk.

My late Father drilled it into my head from an early age.....if you can’t afford something easily, don’t buy it.

With that as a guide, I’ve found that rolling over negative equity into another loan (especially on a depreciating asset....like a car) is a downward spiral. You are essentially trying to fix a broken financial situation by breaking it even more. You’re going in the wrong direction. You’re adding more negative equity to an already poor financial situation.

I will never give any financial advice, as I’m not qualified to do so. Just making some common sense observations.

driver100 - have you not read this story before? 

A man was going down the road from the city of Jerusalem to Jericho. This man was a Jew. As he was walking along, robbers grabbed him. They knocked him down and took his money and his clothes. The robbers beat him up and left him half dead beside the road.
 A short time later, a priest came along that road. He saw the man who was badly hurt. What would you have done?— Well, the priest just went by on the opposite side of the road. He didn’t even stop. He didn’t do anything at all to help the man.
Did you catch the point, driver100? The priest didn't do anything to help the downed Jewish man. Now, you guys know me, I'm not going to get all religious on ya. But that old account from thousands of years ago totally describes what's happening now on the earth. Most people would rather spit on you than help you when you're down. For that poor Jewish man, he was already robbed and beaten. I'll bet that priest would gladly take your tithe on Sunday morning, yet he wouldn't stop and help a man beaten and left for dead on the side of the road. There's a huge moral story told by that one Bible account.

btw....most of the reviews I am looking at for the Sentra give it 3 stars out of 5. Edmunds sums it up pretty nicely;

That said, nothing about the Sentra stands out in the class. Its base engine is one of the slowest available, and even the optional turbocharged engine lags behind some competitors in terms of outright performance. There are also rival sedans that offer nicer interiors and greater degrees of comfort and technology.

A good example is the Kia Forte, which has an extensive list of optional features for a reasonable price. There's also the all-wheel-drive Subaru Impreza that has many excellent active safety features and driver aids available. Finally, the Honda Civic, when equipped with its available turbocharged 1.5-liter engine, is our overall favorite vehicle in the class

EDMUNDS REVIEW

I will say Cars.com gives it glowing reviews. U.S. News rates it high but says there are much better cars in this class, with #1 being a Kia Soul.

Car & Driver with 2 1/2 stars had this to say;
The Sentra has a reputation as a reliable ride at an affordable price, but driving fun is lacking. The SR Turbo has more pep, but it can’t completely hide the car’s basic shortcomings. The tall, boxy body rolls in turns, while the steering is too light, and the brakes do not inspire confidence. Numerous options allow you to tailor the Sentra to your tastes, and the back seat is roomy, but the interior design is plain. Infotainment is good, but Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are not offered.
That sounds like the same faint praise that Mitsubishi gets from the auto press. Maybe those two companies don't grease the right palms. I personally find the Altima much superior but there's nothing wrong with the Sentra.

BTW, can someone walk me through updating my cars owned list on here? I did it in my profile but forget how I did it to get the car to show under my posts.

How's this for a complicated deal......my niece wants to buy her brother's 2017 Civic. Brother bought it in Maryland and rolled negative equity from his trade into the loan. Loan is from Maryland and in that state I understand the bank keeps the title. Indications are he owes $22k on a car worth maybe $16k. Niece has no credit history to speak of so her parents need to cosign. They have tier 1credit but are carrying a lot of debt.

I told them they might have to put in some cash but I'm not sure how much. Are credit unions loaning more than 100% on used cars these days?

He pays off the negative equity. Why would she pay more than the car is worth? Otherwise, run away. Lease a new Civic if necessary.

548,September 18,roadburner,"Since 2001 I've covered four BMW press introductions for Roundel magazine; one was a US intro, the rest were International intros. In two cases I was able to drive a car home and keep it for 10 days. In addition I was loaned two additional cars for other Roundel stories I was writing.
It's no secret that BMW treats journalists very well. That said, it didn't keep Car and Driver from criticizing Munich's lurch towards isolation and away from communicative steering and competent suspensions. A BMW didn't even make the 10 Best list this year. Road & Track was decidedly lukewarm towards the M235i when it was introduced. My latest article covering the intro of the F16 X6 was less than complementary, but I have not been called to task by either my editor or BMW.

All of the above is a roundabout way of saying that I don't think the majority of automotive writers for the major car magazines have a bias against a particular marque. As dino001 correctly observed, most writers are car enthusiasts, and an average car at the rock bottom of the market that does not distinguish itself in any way is simply not going to receive enthusiastic plaudits. Some of my cars have been praised by one magazine and seriously criticized by others. That doesn't bother me- but when every enthusiast magazine I trust agrees that a vehicle is not at all impressive I almost certainly won't consider owning it.

And I can honestly state that I have never purchased a vehicle that finished last in a 5-6 car CD comparison test.
But that's just me

I have the same problem going to those. Since I bought my 2003 WRX, I was spoiled by a straightforward experience I got in both Subaru and BMW dealerships. I didn't always hear what I wanted to hear, but I never had anybody going back on anything. On the other hand, stories I heard from others about their experiences buying their ""mainstream"" cars were just appalling. Korean and Japanese seem to be worst offenders, by far - at least anecdotally. I truly abhor Honda places - they give me real creeps, every time I step in. More even so than Hyundai or Kia. Don't even know exactly why. Perhaps it's those shameless worthless add-ons and ADM stickers still lingering there on some vehicles. Recently our new employee, a young UF masters grad bought a new CRV (nice vehicle) with one of those ""packages"" and the thing wasn't even put on the vehicle. Won't even mention how the whole ""dealing"" went when he was buying. It took him to go to a manager to execute on that stuff. His salesman wouldn't take a call and was gone within couple of weeks, anyway. Just plain awful stuff, but they get away with it, because... you guessed it, ""it's a Honda"".

I just learned to limit my exposure to those places to bare minimum, which ended up being four-five times in last 15 years, when I thought I was shopping for something (then changed my mind). Lucky me, I can afford to be picky.
Right before I bought the Legacy I stopped at the Honda dealer to look at the Civic. The place made my skin crawl. I thought it was just me.

I didn't get more than 10 feet inside the door. I was supposed to meet the manager, but he was on the phone. I slinked out and went away.

If a deal is made for a Sentra, at first blush, here’s the way I see it getting done, if you are really good at the negotiation table.

2018 Sentra base w/manual trans.....$15,000 (probably closer to $16,000 given the dealer will have to overallow on the trade)+ TTL.

2011 Kia Soul base w/manual trans (not sure the mileage, but let’s average 12K/year for 84K miles)......$2K trade (and you’re going to have to work hard to get that). I say the dealer comes in between $1,200 and $1,500 trade on first pencil.
It's a good deal worse then that. If I recall correctly, he owes about $5k on the Kia Soul, putting him upside down about $3k. And it doesn't sound like he has the money to pay off the Kia, so he will have to fold that into the next purchase.

Yeah, I almost forgot about that. An old rule of thumb was 120 percent MSRP as a maximum loan amount, provided the credit score was right. Not sure what it is today.

So, can anybody enlighten me how do we get from $16.9K MSRP and 3+ grand negative equity to $13.5K OTD? Giant slot machine next to the car? Uncle Jim paying for the difference?

I woudn't go so far. I think they are written from certain point of view. It's about reviewer's opinion if there are better products for the same price. The issue is sometimes they use wrong reference points, e.g. MSRP, not actual ""street price"". Some manufacturers price things much closer to street prices than others. Nissan seems to be middle of the road in that department. Its price list usually is on par with say Honda or Toyota product, but the transaction prices are often lower by some decent margin. The reviewers are too lazy (or don't know enough) to account for that. That being said, if somebody thinks that Kia is better (and those often sell at even greater discounts), then this could be a sign.

Another aspect is, small sedan is a very dull segment with cutthroat competition, so the reviewers look for differentiation. It could be looks, equipment, performance, handling, or utility. Sentra is competent evewhere, but does not seem to excel anywhere, so it gets knocked down by people who look for ""something special"" at that price point. It's not malicious, corrupt, or wrong. It's just a different expectations.

If that Sentra was so wrong, it would not sell in those numbers. I say the same - drive what you like, even if it's something I wouldn't want.

Korean and Japanese seem to be worst offenders, by far - at least anecdotally. I truly abhor Honda places - they give me real creeps, every time I step in. More even so than Hyundai or Kia. Don't even know exactly why. Perhaps it's those shameless worthless add-ons and ADM stickers still lingering there on some vehicles. Recently our new employee, a young UF masters grad bought a new CRV (nice vehicle) with one of those ""packages"" and the thing wasn't even put on the vehicle. Won't even mention how the whole ""dealing"" went when he was buying. It took him to go to a manager to execute on that stuff. His salesman wouldn't take a call and was gone within couple of weeks, anyway. Just plain awful stuff, but they get away with it, because... you guessed it, ""it's a Honda"".

I just learned to limit my exposure to those places to bare minimum, which ended up being four-five times in last 15 years, when I thought I was shopping for something (then changed my mind). Lucky me, I can afford to be picky.

The price of the base 6-speed Sentra I'm going for is $13,490. My trade will add to that amount, yes. I think I can strike a do-able deal still.

Also, not all car write-ups are written honestly. I don't believe about 80% of those reviews of the Sentra. They're rubbish!

595,September 18,stickguy,"my take on the reviews is to read the comments, and ignore the results (rankings). Especially with sources that have a narrow focus. Car and Driver is like that. Not wrong or bad necessarily, just the way it is. They will always pick the car that is sportiest (best handling, whatever).

better to look at what they find, and rank based on your own criteria. So if they put a car last that is quiet, comfortable, and soft handling, if that is exactly what you want you might rank it first over something that is noisy and rough but handles like a go cart.

somethings though are pretty cut and dried. performance numbers, lousy brakes, tons of road noise.

My opinion is that most reviews are naturally going to reflect the reviewers leanings no matter how hard they try to avoid that.

All this talk about phone leads me to this, at work they are replacing our old phone system with a VOIP system. We are all getting new phones. These new phones were just installed and until they throw the switch on the new system next week we all have two phones on our desk. The old phone is still fully operational while the new phone can only make outgoing calls so any incoming calls go to the old phone. Our extensions stay the same.

So guess what? I can call myself. I can use the new phone dial in my extension and my old phone will ring showing my name and extension on the display. If I pick it up I can talk to myself.

Man I need more excitement in my life.
Hah! I went through this myself when I was working, it was about 2012 or so. The VOIP phones worked almost the same as the old ones but many of the commands we had all memorized were just different enough to throw people off. For a few weeks it was sheer hell trying to change a voicemail greeting, do a conference, etc. The other thing was that it plugged into your PC so if you had a laptop and it was disconnected for some reason your phone did not work. Eventually it all settled out and the second phone went away.

I have a different take on this. My perception may be different from yours because we don't have many gunfights with police up here so the job is somewhat different. First of all, nobody ""deserves all they can get"" in a public sector job. That sort of entitled attitude brings nothing but problems with it in that environment. We see that in our PD locally where despite most constables making 6 figures plus lavish benefits, there was a systematic ransacking purloining of cash, drugs and other evidence from the property room here for a number of years which the current chief has dragged his heels to even come clean on, much less fix, because it would make so many officers into criminals.

I think most people who go into police work are of a certain mindset and personality type. Most of us wouldn't last a week in the job because we are not that kind of personality. While some seem to have a genuine desire to help people and seek to correct injustice, many others seem to delight in simply having power over citizens. I noticed as well in my work life, where we hired retired PD officers to run our security and loss prevention units, that the longer one is in the police force, the more rigid, jaundiced and discriminatory they seem to become.

The idea of guaranteed, no-strings income has been floated around for a long time, and some smaller cities have already launched experimental programs. The idea of course is that you get that check and then you're on your own as to how to manage your money. It would certainly eliminate gaming the system as it is.

My son is a police officer. It is a dangerous job precisely because it can go from being perfectly ordinary to life threatening in a heartbeat. It’s very stressful. He is not on a power trip and he does not make a six figure salary. I do not understand why some here need to generalize about whole categories of people — police, poor people, teachers — and assume that the worst examples are typical of the whole.

Most people think it's the ""megapixels"" that counts. It's not. It's the lens. Now look at your Nikon's lenses and look at lenses in the phones. The answer is quite obvious. Phone cameras are great for what they are - convenient tool to snap a quick photo of something and make a memory. Not a bad thing, sufficient for majority of the people. But no photo enthusiast (like my late father) would seriously consider a phone camera in the same sentence as your Nikon.

Just had our roof inspected, other than some very minor hail damage it was in pretty good shape and we don't need any work done on it. its 16 years old now, original roof to the house.
My next-door neighbor just had a new steel roof installed. I remember when the previous owner had it reshingled a decade or so ago but the new owner said that she lost some shingles over the winter so went this route. It wasn't cheap, over $6K, and the 2-man crew had it all done in about 6 hours. They didn't remove the old shingles, just installed wood stringers on top of them and then installed the metal panels to those. Strikes me as a profitable trade.

I look forward to watching the avalanches this winter as snow buildup slides off. Another neighbor across the street has a similar roof and you can hear the sound of the snow letting go from inside my house with the windows shut.

638,September 18,bwia,"The verdict is in. The Cadillac XT4 is here and by all reviews Cadillac has hit a home run with this new baby SUV. Interior design was inspired by the 1957 Eldorado Brougham and the pricing starting at $35K is in the sweet spot. Will it sell? Perhaps but the competition is going to be tough from the Volvo XC40, Audi Q3, Mercedes Benz GLA, etc.

Personally the XT4 looks more like an entry level luxury SUV than a true luxury vehicle that the Cadillac name suggests. It appears that GM did not try hard enough to differntiate the XT4 from Chevy Equinox or the GMC Terrain. But what do I know about the car biz compared to former Cadillac CEO Johan de Nysschen who conceived this baby. His legacy will live on for the next five years at least."

Worse yet, most did not have flood insurance. In our area there was a lot of random flooding with many trees down, some on cars, houses, etc. because of wind and saturated soil. On a minor note, a window in one of our bedrooms sprang a leak at the header and made a mess. Luckily I found it early on and was able to minimize the damage.

The recent spat between Saudi Arabia and our idiot Canadian federal govt politicians that prompted SA to recall all their nationals from Canada uncovered a dirty truth about our university system, at least in the area where I live. A good chunk of the seats in our medical school and other post-grad programs were filled with foreign students, many of them Saudis. Why? In part it is because our universities see them as cash cows. They charge them more, they have no fellowships or scholarships to deal with, and according to their calculations these types of students are hugely profitable, hence the opening up of spots for them. This would be no surprise to anyone here who has recently been an inpatient at a local hospital, as I would say the majority of residents and interns are foreign nationals. Their recall resulted in near-panic for the medical system here as suddenly a big part of the doctor base would be forced to leave.

I don't think this will catch on in the US, unless they pump it with hidden incentives to make the payment attractive enough, which will of course cost them on the back end. Also, the insurance thing is risky, as different people have different protection needs. I've seen manufacturers throwing in insurance packages as incentives in other countries, but those have a very standarized insurance market, i.e. there is only one liability coverage limit, usually something like million bucks, or unlimited, as those nations are not run by trial lawyers.

Here is my problem. The lady shown as an example of poorly paid teacher makes $69K/year and claims she sometimes can't pay her utility bills. I'm sorry, but something is wrong with this picture. Granted, $69 grand won't buy you a luxury car and home, but it should be plenty to pay a utility bill, even with two children, unless there is an additional hardship, like illness or special care. Unless she bought a house she can't pay for, due to some misguided notion that only a nice house in ""best school neighborhood"" will give her children a chance. It is also possible she felt a need to ""keep up"" with her more financially successful siblings, which can get you in real trouble quite quickly. I don't want to judge, but 79 grand a year is not a fortune, but it's not a poverty level, either. I lived on less than that for at least 10 years. Granted, I don't have children, but I saved a decent portion of my salary, bought a house during that period, and never had credit card debt, not to mention unpaid utility bills. Something does not add up in her story.

BTW, I'm not saying she is paid enough. I'm just saying she should be able to pay her utility bill for that salary.

Paying obscene amounts of money to the entertainers is a separate issue. I sometimes do think we are civilization in decline, as we do seem to be much more concerned about entertainment and self-image issues that anything else. We are (as a society) willing to pay thousands of dollars to see people running and throwing the ball, buy $10 jersey for $100, because it has some stupid logo on it, or pay somebody millions for singing, or playing guitar.

When ‘she’ instructed them to turn right, they turned right.

When ‘she’ told them to turn left, they complied. They had so much faith in Siri, in fact, that when her instructions guided them through the airport’s motion-activated security gate and down a mile’s worth of flashing warning lights and a series of signs reading no cars allowed, they drove on, ultimately parking on the airport’s landing field.

Living in Seattle, we switched to T-Mobile from the Deathstar after device payment plans got messed up and several months of billing. Haven't looked back since - and actually just moved to T-Mobile One Plus plan thanks to my employee discount.

For the past several years, I just use my phone, and it works fine, especially for scenic snapshot type stuff. In some ways, phones are cameras. I suspect many who would own a camera don't have one now, just using their phone.



I use both Apple and Android-based products. To me, they are tools and I don't care about the story or mythology or back-end technology behind them. I'm all about ""bang for the buck"". A phone is a phone. It's not a camera, it's not a life enhancement and I have no idea if it's changing the world for better or worse.

That was when they were pretty much the only game in town. I never liked them much, found them extremely non-intuitive and difficult to use. I resisted getting one from my employer for years, only relenting when they came out with an iPhone-like product, the Torch. They should have torched it, as it was lousy. Thankfully it broke within 2 years and by then my employer had brought iPhones into their system. Night and day, I liked it immediately. Everything just worked. Then I got an iPad for work also and started using iTunes for a music library. I'm quite satisfied and see no reason to change.

I'm sure the Android devices are fine, sort of, aside from the periodic fires and explosions and hardware failures. But I can't see paying Apple money for a Samsung or LG device. Plus I never cared for the cutesy names of the OS releases. Seems very hackable and quite do-it-yourself too.

740,September 17,dino001,"I'm a ""late adopter"" by nature. Never rush to buy a new thing, especially completely new technology. Part of it is avoiding ""gateway"" devices when spending on one opens you to spend on bunch of other stuff just to make it work. My first Apple device was Nano, 4th generation. My first cell phone was a prepaid Samsung flip phone that I got to stay in touch with my visiting parents as we were meeting away from my home. It was late 2000s (I had no cell phone till then and I was happy). A few years later I got iPad4. Kept upgrading it every two generations (Air 2, last gen), handing down the old one to my folks in Poland. Still kept my flip phone for number of years and would have for a bit longer if not for a fact our office moved and there was no signal in the new building, eating the battery due to constant search. So I switch to AT&T, also prepaid with some cheap phone. That one had truly poor reception (even though the network was strong enough), so I decided finally I was ready for an iPhone - it was 2015. It was also time, when Verizon finally unlocked and unbundled the plans from the phones, which was what I wanted the most (iPhone 6). Upgraded it to the ""seven"" less than two years later, only because my nephew wanted my old one. I may do it again, this time handing my ""seven"" to my sister or mother. Or maybe not. Will see. Still keeping a ""skinny"" plan with 2GB of data, usually not using more than 1 GB in a month. I might use more on occasion, but most of my activities are on Wifi, at home or at work.

BTW, on the late adopter thing. It was only once, when I bought something relative early. It was HD-DVD player, as Costco put it on sale for something like $299, down from $499, or something like that. Looked like a bargain and it still had a major support at that time. Three months later Warner Bros. (Disney) declared to go exclusively with Blueray. Universal had no choice, but to switch at that point (they were the only one left). Three months later from that (or so), Neflix discontinued HD-DVD format on their subscription. Some bargain I got. Looks like it was a last ditch effort from Toshiba to put the players into hands of the users. Even though they were cheaper than Blueray all the way down, it didn't work. The users somehow believed Blueray was superior (full 1080p) in spite of HD-DVD supporting same resolution, but the problem was first releases were in 1080i/720p and it registered in peoples' heads. So my almost new player became a collector's item in six months after purchase.

Let me say this - I grew up on PC, never had a Mac and most likely never will. Just too expensive, period. However, once the technology matured, I did get iPhone and iPad. I like them, I don't love them. It's technology, there is nothing to ""love"". It works, it's useful. Apple's way of making money on some things (like memory upgrades, cheap 5W charger but advertising fast charging capability, no jack adapter in the new models) is just shameless and I sometimes hope people rebel for just a day or a few months, so they stop treating their customers like cows to milk. Their marketing is all about evoking positive feeling while providing as little actual detail as possible. However, the most annoying part of their marketing is, when they come with a feature that was already present on competitive products, sometimes for years, they act like it's an incredible breakthrough, nobody on this Planet ever thought of before genius Apple engineers. If you didn't know, they'd make you believe they invented photography (or at least ""reinvented""), not to mention inductive charging, or wireless headphones. It's truly insulting at times. We all can understand ""truthful exaggeration"" from commercials, or politics, as a part of salesman's toolkit, but there are limits to the insult of our intelligence. But, I guess I'm a hostage - I still buy it, regardless. Stockholm syndrome, anyone?

745,September 17,dino001,"OK, one thing Apple is superior to Android - updates. You buy a flagship Samsung or LG, you may get timely updates. You buy a midlevel phone, also from Samsung, still paying $300, or more - they abandon you the same day, or within a year, not even pretending to care about you. This makes you vulnerable to an attack, as older versions of Android have better recognized exploits and gaps. Apple will get you update for years. I don't buy people saying they'll make it slow on purpose. What's more likely, people use new features on the older machines and not understand it takes more power. Also, the websites, or apps get more complex and require more power to run. I know people with older phones and they're fine with updates, as long as they stay careful about loading up their machines, they're usually fine.

Over the entire constellation of cars which paint color weathers the best. From my experience red is the worst. I've seen serious fade on many red cars. Black is next worst as the clear coat tends to blow out. I think silver looks the best after many years in the sun because it looks the same even when worn. White is the same with the exception of peeling off in sheets sometimes.

I'm sure you have neighbor's that have decks still standing that don't have solar panels on their roofs. So I'm not sure what point you are trying to make. But maybe you should install solar panels on your deck during the snow season just to be sure it is still there come Spring time.

No more bitter than those (of similar demographics around here) complaining about people getting things for free in terms of the social safety net. You and others definitely sound ""bitter"" about that. Everyone gets something for free, in their own way. That was kind of my point. It might relate to glass houses or something like that

IMO, if there is a benefit not remotely attainable by other investors/savers, one supported by another party, it is subsidized. If a fund is not solvent with member contributions, it is subsidized by the someone (the employer, or in more base terms, public funds). I can't think that public sector pensions, which generally provide benefits far better than those available to private sector workers who would make the same contribution, aren't subsidized. How much harder is it for a 25 year old public sector worker saving, vs a private sector worker? When I was 25 and still starting out, I couldn't afford to save as much as I do now, and job security was much less.

Maybe it was different in prior generations. I think now, public sector is often 90% of the pay (at the very worst) with 100% of real-time benefits, 200% of the job security (especially after 5-10 years) and 300% of future benefits. This isn't going to end well. In my anecdotal experience, I have no public sector friends who are starving to support a future pension.
Actually, you still do sound bitter.

A well-managed pension is a good thing to look for when making decisions about a career. It is one of several factors that need to be considered. I don't need to tell you that. BTW your characterization of employer participation in funding a pension is at odds with the very definition of the term. Without employee participation, it is not a pension, it is a retirement savings account. Just like taking vacation time without it being allowed by the employer is being AWOL from work.

I can only speak to what happens where I live. I have read about police chiefs in certain US cities making $1 million annually which if so is lunacy. But here the public sector was not paid well for a very long time. Until about 15 years ago a Deputy Minister (think CEO) of a government agency didn't make $100K a year. That has now changed but most of them here still don't make $200K a year in worthless Canadian dollars. There has been some creep upward in the levels below that but still nothing too spectacular. My former boss who is the CEO of a $600 million a year retailer makes $230K. In Ontario that same job (on a scale several times as large) makes 3 times that. In Alberta the private sector guy who is most equivalent in terms of business size makes over a million a year. But he may not have a pension and can get fired at any time by a vote of the Board of Directors. You pays your money and makes your choice.

A fund to help cushion the landing of someone who loses their job unexpectedly is a good thing. I think we can agree on that. A career choice that depends upon receiving that benefit every year for months at a time for 35 years may test the patience of even the most ""progressive"" of taxpayers. It's like going to the ice cream shop and demanding samples of all 31 flavors because the sign said free.

You seem to be making this into a similar sort of discussion as those on here regarding speeding.

You either do not understand the word subsidy or you are deliberately misusing it. A pension is simply another employee benefit. Typically public sector wages were lower, often far lower, than equivalents in the private sector and so some of those other things you mention were instituted to offset that to an extent although to younger workers they didn't mean much. When the tech boom really hit 20 years ago it became almost impossible for govts here to hire IT people because of the wage disparity. Some private sector employees have their country club memberships subsidized. Some get cars to use. Some can expense a great deal. The list goes on. None of those things would be true for most public sector employees. The grass always seems greener, I suppose. In terms of what the specific terms of the pension may be, those are typically limited by law in terms of eligible amounts of annual salary, % included in the calculation, years of service and the like. If they get too rich the fund becomes insolvent. That's why it is important to have good fund management.

Public sector management is indeed quite different from private sector. When I worked in govt it was virtually impossible to fire someone, especially when they were in the union. While there were some good performers and hard workers, the majority were just OK, and there were some who had no business being there but you could not get rid of them, so they kept getting shuffled around until they could retire. Performance reviews were a useless exercise and accountability was only a word that had little actual meaning. The same symptoms affected top management, some of whom were appointed because of their skill at manipulating the political decision makers, not their management skills. Others made their name at coming up with policy initiatives or being technocrats but never had to manage more than a handful of folks and also lacked financial skills. When the inevitable disasters happened on their watch it was no surprise. This is in large part why Canada, which loves big government and has a seeming majority who want even more government services provided, cannot effectively deliver the public services currently in place. The mismanagement, inefficiency and waste is a sight to behold, and the bureaucracy effectively prevents any meaningful reform.

If a benefit is being kept afloat by massive distant party inputs, especially those far in excess of most of those technically providing the funding, I will call it subsidized. When there's no way nearly any private sector employee would be able to earn the return gained by a public sector pensioner, I will call it subsidized. It doesn't seem to disagree with any definition I can find.

I have friends who are in non-union (as far as I know) public sector management roles, and are still virtually unfireable, simply due to policies around tenure. That's a hell of a perk that I can easily counter with if one mentions a minor salary difference. I won't judge their performance - they aren't lazy or inept, but oftentimes private sector cuts just don't target bad workers either. I am generally a fan of social goods, but not so much a fan of two tier or two class systems.

Speaking of Canada, I know BC has a gigantic and not terribly efficient public sector, it'll be interesting to see what happens with taxes there to keep it going, or when a large group from that sector retires. Going to have to tax the money laundering in local real estate even more.

Each joist was also pre-stained as were the 6x6 end supports.  Over a 10 year period, I never had to replace a board due to rot - only boards I ever had to replace (3) were because they split.

In my area anyway, there's no way a normal person would get the same ROI (other than maybe the lucky generations who were able to dabble in real estate) as the contributions of public sector pension collectors.
If by ""jackpot"" you mean paying 19% of every paycheck into the pension fund then I guess so.

Everyone who doesn't work under the table pays into an unemployment insurance system here, too. Many people will never use it. Some people abuse it. Some will be saved by it when the need arises. IMO, the good outweighs the bad, and such systems are required if a society is to call itself developed.

Not to my knowledge. The employer contributed a matching amount like most pensions plans require. Ours is stable and from the annual reports seems well managed; however the teacher's plan here is a separate one and it has been floundering for years because of under-contributions by members and poor administration that allows far too generous payouts. That one has been bailed out a couple of times and now requires another.

The EI system here needs reform of some sort. One thing that has been floated is a maximum lifetime cap on payments received from it, to reduce the systemic nature of certain professions sucking it dry.

Tax levels here in the USA are often higher in actuality than what people believe. As a self-employed contractor, I pay 5.6% social security, plus another 5.6% (the part your employer usually pays), plus 2.6% for medicare. That's 15.2% BEFORE you even get into FICA (income tax). I hold back 36% of every dollar earned and send it to the government quarterly.

I wouldn't mind living in a country with higher taxation who actually does more for it's citizens (Canada, for example).

All in all, though, I'm happy with where I'm at, and how I'm doing. I could be a heck of a lot worse off.

The interest rates were held artificially low for political purposes cause it made the interest overhead on the debt load lower than if interest rates had risen naturally. Also spending the QE monies went directly into the pockets of the friends in the stock market and banking industry.

Now that rates are being allowed to adjust and we aren't dumping QE monies out of tax funds, the increase in tax collections from the greatly improved economy will help the interest rates give returns for people and retirement systems wanting dependable income without risking monies in the stock and other markets to as great a degree. The low interest rates hurt older and retired people most.

820,September 14,henryn,"I can’t remember where I originally posted about Batteries Plus, it was either here or CCBA, but the crowd is about the same, so …

Quick recap, I purchased my 2016 Town and Country used, and only received one key fob. Earlier this week, I dropped that key fob, from waist height, onto concrete, and the remote functions stopped working. I can open the door with the emergency key, and the fob still starts the car, so it is driveable.

I looked around, and the best deal I could find for a new key fob was Batteries Plus. $180 all in, including sales tax, so I did the deal, they charged my credit card immediately, sent me an email saying they would let me know when I pick up my key fob and have it programmed.

This morning, two days later, I get an email saying that the local store has “declined” my order. WTH?? I called the local store, they do not answer the phone, so I leave a voice mail. That was about 4 hours ago, and they haven’t called back. I have called Amex and contested the charge, gone on Yelp and gave them a really really negative review. In the meantime, I have been calling around. One locksmith (the one recommended by Angie’s List) quoted $280. When I told him that was more than the dealer, he replied, “We charge more for the convenience.” Yeah, right, goodbye.’

Finally found a locksmith who was willing to do the job for $195, all in, if I could come to them and pay cash. Except they can’t do it today, booked up, call back on Monday.

Any young people out there looking for a lucrative income without 4 or more years of college, I can definitely recommend locksmithing.

You sound bitter.

Employer matching is hardly a ""subsidy"". It is a benefit like dental care or vacation time or any other employee benefit. I can tell you that for the first part of may career I certainly didn't see it that way. ""Why is all this money deducted every paycheck from my take-home?"" was a typical complaint. That was particularly hard to swallow in the early years when you were just getting started and money was tight. It's hard to appreciate the value of a retirement pension when you are in your 20s. The argument that was made to me back then was that it was a trade-off - I could make a lot more in the private sector, but the pension and benefits were usually not as good and job security wasn't great. I know lots of people who left government jobs for the private sector pot of gold. It's simply a choice one needs to make.

Now you may have a valid gripe against companies in the private sector no longer offering pension plans as was once typical for larger operations. And it is also true that mismanagement of a lot of pension plans both public and private caused a lot of problems. But let's be clear - when you look at the way investment funds have grown over the last 20-30 years, even with the periodic corrections in the market, a decently-managed pension plan should have no difficulty being sustainable long-term.

Agreed. When I take office On January 1, 2019 the state will take 5% of my salary, ""match"" it with 4% and stick it into a pension fund. I can't opt out, and believe me I wish I could; I'd make more money long term investing that 5% myself...

825,September 14,berri,"I also believe the employer max is capped by tax law, just like the individual's contributions. Why can't they just do what they want? I think beyond the max cap it becomes taxable to the employee."
826,September 14,fintail,"No more bitter than those (of similar demographics around here) complaining about people getting things for free in terms of the social safety net. You and others definitely sound ""bitter"" about that. Everyone gets something for free, in their own way. That was kind of my point. It might relate to glass houses or something like that

IMO, if there is a benefit not remotely attainable by other investors/savers, one supported by another party, it is subsidized. If a fund is not solvent with member contributions, it is subsidized by the someone (the employer, or in more base terms, public funds). I can't think that public sector pensions, which generally provide benefits far better than those available to private sector workers who would make the same contribution, aren't subsidized. How much harder is it for a 25 year old public sector worker saving, vs a private sector worker? When I was 25 and still starting out, I couldn't afford to save as much as I do now, and job security was much less.

Maybe it was different in prior generations. I think now, public sector is often 90% of the pay (at the very worst) with 100% of real-time benefits, 200% of the job security (especially after 5-10 years) and 300% of future benefits. This isn't going to end well. In my anecdotal experience, I have no public sector friends who are starving to support a future pension.

I hope Mr. Fintail also notices the executives are well taken care of in companies while the workers who actually do the jobs as compensated without defined pension plans when possible and are told they can contribute to 401k plans as their retirement plans, sometimes with a setup to match may 3-5% of their pay if the employee contributes appropriate amounts.

The same executive pay ratios compared to the workers in the same company have gone higher and higher since I started noticing in the 70s when I started investing. That excess compensation could be used to improve workers pension security.

Very nice deck and great workmanship. BTW, the flooring does not look treated, is this by design or an exotic material other than wood?
Looking at it from the Burgh it looks like classic #1 (almost knot-free) pressure treated Southern Yellow Pine deck boards that have not been stained yet. This grade of wood costs more but is well worth it in the end. I've used this wood for 3 of my own decks and I'm not the least bit sorry I sprung for this grade of deck material.

When I lived in my first house, the back yard was one step down from the kitchen and dining room so in the mid 70's I poured a 12 by 20 foot concrete patio. Never had to do any maintenance. Concrete is the way to go if you have the right lot. I don't think pressure treated wood even existed in the mid 70's but even if it did I wouldn't have used it.

861,September 14,nyccarguy,"Thank-you all for your kind words.  As @jmonroe1 pointed out, the deck flooring is made of southern, yellow, pine.  It has not yet been treated or stained because it is still “wet.”  Most likely I will have it stained or treated this Spring.

The railings and spindles (anything White) is a product called Azec.  It is recycled plastic that is very durable and virtually maintenance free.

Amazing though.  The permits, drawings, & various other things required by the city of Stamford cost 1/3 of the price of the deck.

Speaking as an ex-social worker the question of who is the ""deserving poor"" has been debated for over a hundred years. I personally raised a family, built a house and saved money for the kids' education while making as little as $12k a year. We never took free lunches even though the income limit was $70,000.

How did we do it? As Fintail suggested, we worked three jobs and bootstrapped it.. Didn't take vacations and drove junkers. Was it easy? Heck no. But our kids never went hungry, always had school supplies and I hope learned the value of work. I'm not saying that some folks don't need the help but some are using a system designed by corrupt vote buying politicians to get a freed ride.

The problem is that there is no easy way to weed out deserving and undeserving people.
Some people just seem to have bad luck. I knew someone like that. His luck was so bad you really got to the point where you didn't want to even be standing next to him. It was very disturbing in a way. He almost seemed cursed, and I don't even believe in that stuff.

918,September 13,dino001,"I'm not offended by starting prices of those iPhones. They are generally in line with other flagships and wannabes (at least on the list price level). However, charging $150 and $350 extra those higher storage models is a true highway robbery with an insult for good bye. Those things cost Apple probably somewhere around 10 bucks, maybe a little more. I just saw Best Buy 1 TB (!) solid state drive sale for less than $200 (starting list price was of course around $400, still not a fortune, considering how much those things used to cost). That includes the board, case, connectors, box and cost of retailing the item (imagine volume discounts on that).

Apple is charging same price on storage upgrades, as they did when those NaND chips cost 10 times as they do today. That is truly insulting to its customers, but they get away with that. Unfortunately, I'm one of those suckers, who ends up paying up for that and while I understood it five years ago, today I'm less and less happy about it. I may still end up paying up again. I want my music be stored in high quality format (lossless compression), which is around 10 MB per file, as I can't stand listening to lossy compressed files (mp3, mp4).

I can't believe an IPhone 7 should be unusable. Is this related to the battery slowdown Apple admitted to a year ago and offered a replacement battery at a moderate price?
Not sure what you mean by unusable. My mother is still using my old iPhone 6 and it's just fine for her. She didn't even change that battery, something I may actually take care when she comes and visits me. The software is showing the battery is still fine. The whole slowing down issue was more public relations problem than actual issue. Apple made a change to protect the phones from powering down when battery is weak and the demand is spiking. The problem is they only told that once in the update description that nobody, reads of course. So, to console the angry mob, they offered cheap battery replacement. I bet it will expire and they will not extend it. I think they should, but they are used to charging people whatever pops to their heads and getting away with it, so why should they suddenly volunteer charging less (see my post above about the NaND chips)?

924,September 13,dino001,"Speaking about those designs and pricing of items, I just discovered something that really shattered my sense of engineer's pride of their work. My 4-month LG dishwasher stopped working. The guy came and opened it, it's the control circuit board. OK, happens, not great, but those things somethings burn out in their early usage. That's what warranties are for.

However, as he was opening the control compartment, the guy mentioned that those dishwashers with top control panels often short, as water can enter there from the spills on the counter. Mine was clean inside, so no water - however, I discovered the compartment, where all the electronics are placed is NOT SEALED!!!. This is ridiculous. So there is seal and protection from water inside the dishwasher, but when it comes to counter spills, you are completely on your own. Considering most dishwashers are positioned next to the sink, this is totally outrageous.

I'm sure it's not unique to LG, I'm sure everybody does that. As the guy said, the issue is common to all those with top controls, which today is majority, as they are considered better fashion than front controlled, why I don't know I guess women of the house decided that's nicer. So all of those better ones, with more features also come with controls up top.

Interesting thoughts by everyone, especially @ab348 in that people have no problem identifying as ""poor"" to get free things. I don't have a problem with free or subsidized school lunches. But, here in Dallas, they are starting to push to provide free breakfasts also and a free meal before the child leaves school in the late afternoon. What kind of motivation does that give a parent to provide for their children when three meals are provided if they ask and meet some sort of loose guideline? I don't understand it, really.

I apologize if I'm running this into the ground. I'll be quiet about it now.
Speaking as an ex-social worker the question of who is the ""deserving poor"" has been debated for over a hundred years.

How did we do it? As Fintail suggested, we worked three jobs and bootstrapped it.. Didn't take vacations and drove junkers. Was it easy? Heck no. But our kids never went hungry, always had school supplies and I hope learned the value of work. I'm not saying that some folks don't need the help but some are using a system designed by corrupt vote buying politicians to get a freed ride.

The N55 motor in the M240i is rated at 335 hp. The new M2 Competition does have 405 hp.
The M240i has a bit longer gearing than the M235i, so the M240i doesn't pull ahead until around 70 mph- it winds up being a half second faster to 100 mph.

If I went with another 2er I'd order it so I could delete the sunroof. An M2 or M2C is much less likely to have a hole in the roof, so I will probably go CPO.

That's a lot of money to replace a fuel tank. I replaced a few gas tanks when I was younger, they tended to rust out before the rest of the car. This being in Texas, no salt. It was pretty easy 40 or 50 years ago to swap out a gas tank. The last time I dropped one was on a 1984 Ford F150, to replace the sender for the fuel gauge, and that was relatively easy, half a day.

It seems that many (most?) newer cars have the fuel pump in the gas tank, high pressure gas lines, evaporative
control systems, all kinds of things to make the job harder and more expensive. Oh, well. (big sigh)

I did that too — oh wait, that was in 1979. Gas was less than a dollar a gallon, you could get a decent used car for a few hundred $$, and my first house cost less than my car today. What you could do back then can’t be done for the same amount as now. The working poor do all the things you say. They just have to have more $ to make ends meet because everything costs more. That’s why the poverty line is higher.

948,September 12,henryn,"My story about parking for a funeral.

Back around 2002 or 2003, we had a big fifth wheel travel trailer, which we pulled with a big Ford diesel F250. Anyone familiar with big heavy travel trailers will tell you that they tend to eat tires. Blowing out tires is just part of the overhead. Whenever I set out on a trip, I always had at least two spares.

One day I’m driving down a 2 lane state highway, no real shoulders, and blow out one of the tires on the travel trailer. We were just coming in to a small town, right there in front of me was a funeral home, with a nice big empty parking lot. I figure 10 minutes to jack up the trailer and swap the tire, no big deal. I was quite practiced at swapping tires on that rig. So I pull into the parking lot, taking up a great deal of space, and start doing my thing.

No sooner do I have the rig up on the jack, and cars start pulling in. One after the other, a solid stream. Apparently they had a service of some kind, or a viewing, or something, scheduled for 5:00 p.m., and I parked in their parking lot at 4:55. Being a small town, everyone living close by, they all show up at the same time, at the last minute. The director or head man or whatever comes out and asks me politely if I can move. I tell him, “Man, I’m really sorry, I had no idea. I’m working as fast as I can, I will be out of here in 5 minutes.”

I asked him where I should park my car until he could determine whose car it was so it could be moved.  He suggested I park in the main guest parking lot 4 blocks away.

Just as I was about to pull my car from behind the vehicle in my reserved spot, one of the mourners visiting came over and said it would be 6 hours before the car would be moved - the ending time for visitors to the family.  I asked that the car be moved NOW because I just returned from a 5 hour trip from Jacksonville and was in no condition to walk 4 blocks to park my car.

The guy looks at me and says, “...sue me!”  The security officer insisted that the car be moved immediately.  This guy told the security officer to f...off!  Now, five more mourners come down to the parking lot and started cursing me out because I had called security on them.

This did not end peacefully!  The man who owned the car finally moved it and said I was an insensitive SOB.  Further, that I had some nerve causing this confrontation during visitation of the mourners.

I tell you - I have no luck in this world - all I did was call security - I didn’t know someone had died.  And even so, I had no place to park and I was exhausted from the long drive.  My parking spot is my property and states so in my deed and homeowners association contract.

Now I’ll have a ghost haunting me for wanting to park in my own space.  I give up!

You're right about that but that's the price you pay when you cheat like @roadburner is doing and taking his car to a shop.

Back in the mid 70's I had to replace a brake line on my '68 Olds and called the dealer to have all of them replaced. The price was out of sight so I asked about having just the rusted out line replaced just to get the car back on the road. My plan was to do the rest myself at my convenience. Of course that would not have cost nearly as much but the dealer couldn't get me into the shop for 3 days and an independent shop couldn't get me in for 2 days. That was better but not good enough so I went to the parts store and bought the premade lines in the lengths as close to what I needed but a little longer. I wanted to cut the lines that were too long and buy the double flare tool and remake that end but no one had it so I had to ""hide"" the extra length as best as I could. I did that by bending the line that went from the master cylinder to the ""T"" mounted on the differential unit in a sine wave in a few places to take up about 5 or 6 extra inches. I lucked out with the lines that ran along the rear axle from the ""T"" to the rear brake cylinders because they were only about 1 inch too long. Took me the better part of a Saturday evening but I never had a problem. The car always stopped just like it was supposed to do.

I don't plan to ever do that again but it was a good experience.

$378 looks about right for a $20k car plus TTL, assuming little down. Because used buyers at that price are probably still financing out as far as new car buyers. 5 years on a brand new car, with a good rate, is OK to me, but no way I am doing that on a 3 YO one.

I actually use a 5 year look back rule. New car can go 5, then sliding scale to 5YO needs to be cash. So 3 YO car could do 2 years. This also roughly overlays the warranty period (at least powertrain).

I had asked about what vehicle to rent to ferry table decorations, balloons, luggage, and 3 people to Columbus next month. I took the recommendations and went in for a minivan. Couldn't see that on either Hertz or Enterprise online. So I went to the local office. The Hertz guy was brusque and said they're all booked up through October. He said they wouldn't even have a small car. Check online occasionally in case there's a cancellation.

I trundled on over to the Enterprise office which was my first choice. Office manager looked on computer and found minivans available for the 5 days I want to rent one. He took my DL and said they'd call me about two days before to be sure I still wanted the vehicle.

Texting vs leaving a voice mail message -- depends entirely on whom you're trying to communicate with. Most of the younger generation will never actually listen to a voice mail. They will notice the missed call, call me back, and say something like, ""I saw your call, what's up?"" Whereas if I send a text saying, ""I need you to send me the address for cousin Brucie"", I will get a text reply with the address.

And to all of you who say you don't have and don't need a smart phone -- have you ever seriously considered the benefits of having the internet available as you move around? You're in the auto parts store, and they want $200 for a pair of brake rotors, a quick check on RockAuto or Amazon, and you can get them for half that price. You're in WalMart, and they have a 40"" LED TV for $199. Is that a good price? 30 seconds on your smart phone, and you know if it is. You're in some strange locale, where you've never been before, you're in a rent car with no NAV, and you're lost. Whip out your smart phone, 30 seconds later you're back on track. Anyone selling good Italian food within 10 miles? Bingo.

It's very seldom that a day goes by that I don't look up something on the internet using my phone. And I'm the kind who never uses a smartphone (or tablet) if there is a real computer available.

Heh. Back in the mid-to-late 00's when all of the politicians I dealt with got Blackberry devices they soon discovered that (at least back then) BBMs which I gather were Blackberry's version of a text were not covered under Freedom of Information laws. So instead of making phone calls to tell someone something that they didn't want to be unearthed later, they would send BBMs. Same with emails that bore the legend in all caps on the first line ""DELETE AFTER READING"".

They also just bought a house a year ago and have the same feelings about debt that I do, so I get that there are places you can economize. And I think they look at their phones sort of how I do... pretty much for emergency communications. Like if you get stuck on the road somewhere and need to call for assistance, or if the traffic is heavy and you want to let someone know you'll be late. Or to send a text to remind someone to get milk on the way home.

I bet I haven't made 10 phone calls in all the time I've had a cell phone, right from a ""brick"" through the flip phone, and now with the Android. Somehow, we're able to live life without being in constant communication with someone else. We also seems to be able to sit in a restaurant and not even think about getting our phones out.

If I'm at home, I have at least one computer running. I would never think of using a phone for the internet if there's a running computer in the next room, or even right in front of me. So we're in agreement on that. And I don't talk on the phone very much, and 90% of my texting is done on the computer through Google Voice.

But when I'm not at home, and don't have a computer with an internet connection readily available, being able to look up stuff on the phone is VERY handy. And it does not need to be expensive.

You can get a very nice 2 year old smartphone for well under $200. Heck, you can get a nice new smartphone for $250. And outfits like MintSim will sell you 2 gigabytes of data for $15 a month. If you're not streaming music and videos, you will never exceed 2 gigabytes. Period. My lunch today (quick and hurried in the cafeteria, no drink) cost me right at $11.

He apologized to Mrs D ""because it must be upsetting for her, ""because she has to put up with me when I am angry - I am sorry driver got mad"". His (S-I-L) apology was an insult, the apology should be because he was a moron and a thief for the B&E and theft of the car....not because he upset me. What he is saying is he did nothing...it is my reaction he is sorry for. So, the words said are just as important as the apology itself.

I am glad an apology was at least given, I am not sure there is much understanding of why what was said was so wrong. That's fine.........I am finished talking about it. No problem.

1068,September 11,iluvmysephia1,"This is 'Gold Pony's' review of the 2016 Nissan Sentra SR Turbo 6-speed I am honing in on buying. I am thinking of driving the 461 miles west to Phoenix tomorrow and test-driving a 2017 model SR in Red Alert color. This car is head and shoulders above the basic 'S' model Sentra it isn't funny. It has heated leather seats, a sunroof, leather gearshift knob, leather-wrapped steering wheel, blue stitching in various parts of the interior, Bose 6-speaker stereo in which Gold Pony states the bass is great on, NAV seems to be included, you can integrate your phone through Bluetooth I'm assuming, so you can use YouTube or Google off your phone. That sounds like Android Auto but it's not called that - I'll have to check that out! I like that feature a lot. The lip spoiler with the thin strip of lighting that comes on in the rear when you hit the brakes. Push button start, key fob that allows you to just have your key in your pocket when you get close to your car, ample rear legroom, etc. This car isn't missing anything I'd want in a sporty car - it reminds me a lot of my 2008 Mitsubishi Lancer GTS quite a bit - I think psychologically I'm trying to get back to that car through this one. We'll see which one I like the most.

The video after this one that I'm watching right now mentions that the 2017-19 Sentra SR Turbo model is Nissan's first turbo-charged engine? What? He must mean it's the Sentra model's first turbo-charged engine. Nissan engineers pulled the engine outta the Juke for this Sentra SR Turbo. 0-60mph in 7.2 seconds IIRC the numbers correctly. My last day off is tomorrow and I'll need to get going early since it's a long drive to Phoenix from here.

President Donald Trump offered some business advice to Ford Motor on Sunday: because of the administration's high tariffs on car imports from China, Ford can start making its Focus Active in the United States.

Breaking financial news from Ford: they tell Trump why they can't build their Focus Active in the U.S.


""It would not be profitable to build the Focus Active in the U.S. given an expected annual sales volume of fewer than 50,000 units,"" Ford said Sunday.

The statement came after Trump tweeted about an article from August 31, when Ford announced that it was canceling plans to make the Focus Active, a compact crossover, in China and ship them to the United States.

Allright, Don. Easy enough mistake ta make.

""This is just the beginning. This car can now be BUILT IN THE U.S.A. and Ford will pay no tariffs!"" Trump wrote, citing a Reuters article posted on CNBC.

The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods, including some automobiles, in a move Trump has touted as necessary to punish Beijing for what he says are its unfair trade practices and intellectual property theft. China has retaliated in kind, and Washington and Beijing have continue to ratchet up threats of more tariffs.

Ford spokesman Michael Levine said the Focus Active is built in Europe. The company had plans to begin making the vehicle in China in the latter half of 2019 and exporting them to the US market.

But Ford said last month that it was scrapping that plan because Trump's tariffs would make the cars too expensive.

The company also reaffirmed that it has no plans to start making the car on US soil. It will continue to sell the vehicle outside the states.

Sedans and other small cars are falling out of favor with Americans.

Ford already announced earlier this year that it would reallocate $7 billion of research and development funds from cars to SUVs and trucks. Executive James Farley said at an investor's conference in January that the carmaker's lineup is ""shifting from cars to utilities.""

It's not just Ford. All three Detroit automakers have made it clear that they're going all-in on SUVs and trucks.

Ford added in its statement that it's committed to ""growing its U.S. vehicle lineup - including introducing all-new trucks, utilities, hybrids and fully electric vehicles.""

The company said about 80% of the vehicles Ford sells in the United States are built domestically.

There is no problem with imposing tariffs on particular good at particular rates, if it is thought through and applied in a way that actually might be beneficial. Slapping tarriffs on everything with no thought causes a tariff war. No one wins a tariff war. And, it is very hard on business....they plan on buying supplies etc at certain costs. Then a monkey wrench is thrown into their business model.

Take one industry for example.....the building industry in Canada. Many buildings were planned, but, the estimated building cost has risen, because of the 25% tariff on steel. Many projects are on hold.

The Ford example is a good one. You can't expect businesses to invest, when the government steps in and changes the rules so drastically suddenly. Harley Davidson is a good example. Pres says consumer can buy something else if they don't build in the USA. Someone who wants an HD is not going to want something else.

Nothing wrong with changing the rules....but, it has to be done in a thoughtful way, usually with input from experts.

While those effects may be true, one would think that they would be affecting all manufacturers to some extent in a similar way. I do not see many cars here with sheets of paint peeling away, certain decade-old Hondas excepted. The Toyota example strikes me as odd in that they built their rep by being supposedly bulletproof in quality and reliability and by standing behind their products over the long term. Their actions here sound more akin to Hyundai, Chrysler or Ford.

Also interesting in that the article references the Edmunds site in noting the paint issues, which would tend to indicate they are widespread.

A Cincy radio car repair talk show had a call about something failing on Rav4. I tried to remember what it was but failed. The mechanic said that item has been a problem on some years and is showing up now. However, the same guy is always talking about how bulletproof the toyotas are and always bragging about how he loves them. And about how many he owns. He owns two shops that sell tires and do mechanical work.

Oh, he advertises for an area toyota store on his show--did I mention that?

All cars have problems. Sometimes people like to pretend there are none because the company has enough profits they can pay to fix things even after the original warranty period. And then people tend to think there were no transmission problems, e.g., in the car they had.

As to the paint, I recall GM paint problems on certain colors in the 80s IIRC were because PPG and others had manufacturer go to a different system. They used a primer and then a color coat over the primer followed by clear coat. The color coat let go of the primer. Earlier systems for paint had a primer followed by a bonding coat to let the color coat adhere to it. Then the clear coat. AND the color coat let go of the primer (or vice-versa). PPG was paying part of coat to recoat some vehicles. I think silver was one color that had more trouble than the others.

I think imid hit it....no matter how good a car maker is, something can go wrong. Employee missed filling up paint can with primer. Or a new primer not formulated properly.

1099,September 10,imidazol97,"There also is the cost factor. Some companies have had a profit advantage by being nonunion and having lots of cash to spend fixing problems that show up. That works very nicely because people tend to forget that their transmission went out of the AC compressor blew up in the middle of that trip to Phoenix last summer, when the manufacturer repairs it and even extends coverage after the warranty.

Some other companies have been strapped for cash to do those kinds of things. I frequent forums with questions about things that go wrong and I am appalled at the logic of many people who complain that the 18-year old car they bought used, e.g., has something going wrong that happens to others. AND then they complain that the manufacturer doesn't fix it free under a recall. When do people become responsible for things rather than somebody else's paying to fix it.

I just replaced the bushings on the lower control arms on my Cobalt at 130,000 miles.

We had neighbors who would let their horse out to graze in our pastures- without permission of course(they would claim there was a break in the fence). One day we found the horses running loose so we led them out to the other side of our farm and released them into town. The owners spent the better part of a day and a night rounding them up.
Don't get me started on ""Service Animals."" I had a city resident ask that his goats be exempted from our ""No livestock"" ordinance on the grounds that the goats were ""Emotional Support Animals.""

I corrected that to the new log in which is forums.edmunds.com/discussions/bookmarked

But occasionally my chrome ended up with the login box on the left instead of the right and was trying to log in through the old pattern using a URL that had a whole bunch of stuff after the forward slash mark. It was using one of the pages I'd looked at that were stored in the previous URL's. On trying to log in, chrome would select one of those that contained what I""d already typed and use it to auto-complete.

I have tried deleting those one-by-one out of the old list, but chrome keeps saving them. So when I type
""forums.edmunds.com and hit enter expecting Chrome to autocomplete with the ""/discussions/bookmarked"" it instead chose another one out of the flyout menu under the URL line.

I have to redo the entry and make sure the autocomplete part is deleted before pressing Enter.

1132,September 9,henryn,"RE: Gap insurance

A quick google search found this:

Pearse says Travelers calculates gap insurance premiums at roughly 5 percent to 6 percent of the premium for collision and comprehensive insurance you have on the car. On a $1,400 annual premium — with $420 to $560 of that typically for collision and comprehensive — gap insurance would cost $20 to $30. And the cost goes down along with the cost of collision and comprehensive as the vehicle ages.
Pearse says one of the biggest mistakes consumers make in buying car gap insurance is to buy it at the dealership where it costs more. “It’s the belief that you can only purchase it from the vehicle manufacturer at the time of sale,” he says. “The truth is that you can purchase it any time and insurance companies are less expensive.”
If you are upside down on your car loan (or lease), then you most definitely should spend that $20 or $30 a year. But do it through your insurance company. Just my opinion, of course.

And on that pet cow: My opinion would be that the owner of the cow should be responsible for any damage caused by the cow. And I also agree with @thebean, I would have had a few choice words (or more) with the idiot who shot my cow.

A family cow was shot and killed Wednesday morning in rural Maine after police said the animal wandered from its owner’s property and scratched a parked SUV. The cow — a young female heifer — rubbed its horns against the rear fender of a Lincoln Navigator parked on the property and damaged it. A person living in the house on the property came outside armed with a .45-caliber handgun and shot the cow, which wandered to a nearby field, where it was shot a second time. Read full article at:

That's a little extreme isn't it? Torture as a punishment for animal cruelty? It depends on the laws of the state but usually livestock is considered personal property and shooting the cow would be like scratching your neighbor's car in retaliation for him scratching yours. More a civil penalty rather than criminal. They might be able to charge him criminally for the second shot as a deliberate act of cruelty. I suppose the real animal rights activists would want the farmer charged too as a slave owner.

I still have their card and combing all the discounts and extra benefits they beat everybody else by at least 10 percent, if not more.

my TV story. In our bedroom we have a brand new 50 inch Sony TV that my wife won in a raffle so the price was perfect. 

In our family room we have a 65 inch off brand of which I currently can't remember that we bought from Eddie Bauer for $200. Yeah I said Eddie Bauer, they were closing a store near us and were selling everything including the fixtures. We managed to scoop up their big TV they used there to promote their stuff. So far that TV has been great, great picture and sound and we cant beat the price.

Those TV panels that retailers use are very heavy duty and built to take a lot of abuse. Problem with most of them, no one has bothered to guard against burn in. Some of the later plasmas had moving pixels to guard against burn in. But, they were tanks.

If you can find one that works well, it’s likely to last you decades.

Like most things electronic, the older the technology gets, the less the price. LCDs drove plasmas out of the market because of how much it cost to manufacture plasmas. LCDs won on price (like VHS over Beta).

That said, the state of LCDs today is pretty darned good. You can get a good TV, even a 55” one, for way less than $500.

That makes me cringe when I think I paid $5K for my plasma not too many years ago. But, it still chugs along and is built like a tank. Problem is, I like my LG OLED better, so my plasma isn’t getting much use these days.

I read the post. I think he is mistaken that she bought and financed the car.....I would think she must have leased it. I guess there could be another factor when this happens. There may be more owing on the car than what the car is worth at this time. For example, let's say the car owner still owed $12000 for the car, but the insurance company says the car is worth $10000 because of extra miles on it. Maybe the dealer has to take her to court to get their money. What does happen in those cases?
The story seems to have large holes in it. I think it was likely a loan, not a lease. As such, one has to cover difference between insurance payout and loan balance. It's easy to imagine somebody owing more than the car is worth in that case, it's probably the case for large percentage of the loans out there. In that case, the insurance pays actual cash value minus deductible and the customer has to cover the rest.

In case of leases, at least those done by mainstream banks and manufacturer finance arms, all have GAP coverage included in the payment. In that case, insurance pays ACV minus the deductible and GAP pays the rest.

Help needed:
I just saw a post in another topic here asking about a used car dealer who financed a car charging for over-miles on a car totaled in an accident. Is that possibly true?

https://forums.edmunds.com/discussion/52352/general/x/can-used-dealer-charge-over-mileage-on-a-financed-car
I read the post. I think he is mistaken that she bought and financed the car.....I would think she must have leased it. I guess there could be another factor when this happens. There may be more owing on the car than what the car is worth at this time. For example, let's say the car owner still owed $12000 for the car, but the insurance company says the car is worth $10000 because of extra miles on it. Maybe the dealer has to take her to court to get their money. What does happen in those cases?

That's what I suspected. A sleazy used car place led her to believe she was buying but she was actually leasing. Likely a BHPH lot.

The Rockford Files was my favorite TV show growing up for a lot of reasons, part of which was the Mike Post musical scoring. This is nearly an hour of the scoring used just in the first season and it makes me happy to hear it. It made me think about what a tough job it must have been to score a series - having the producers tell you we need this, and this, and this, all in different styles and invoking different things, while still (at least in this case) maintaining a common theme for every piece.

But isn't Edmunds.com a car site or am I wrong here? Sometimes folks get too comfortable, like a family of sorts.
The renaming in this topic to a cars and coffee and conversation label was to represent that topics wander about to suit more of what the car fans here find interesting. The examples are televisions, sound systems for home and cars, juicers, speeding tickets, court procedures, Neons, Timex, long term warranties, job changes, insurance brands, houses, water heaters, dishwashers, washers and dryers, usw.. All that along with electric vehicles and rental vehicles and companies. I've probably missed some of the topics. While I find a few not as interesting as a topic, but they are interesting because they involve people I ""know"" as posters and ""sort of friends"" here on the forum. I've asked more technical questions hoping that one of the people more expert may venture an answer about my topic.

Certainly the cars and coffee type of posts have kept this forum alive, not as alive as the car-buying bunch in Chronic Car Buyers, but good. LOL The topics are more interesting than hearing posts about the popular car brand that is nearly perfect of the month where everyone agrees that brand is the one to buy and agree there must be a few lesser models or brands to purchase. All that overlooking certain brands or models in any mentions of options in car purchasing.

I've learned that some of the most avid pursuers of great handling and power are very realistic reviewers of the more pedantic models, including, yes, even the Malibu for folks like me here in the Heartland. Other are more dogmatic in their opinions often never having driven the model in question other than a rental version that's often a grim example.

My thinking, hoping others do the same if I venture into offending someone, is that I take a breath and forgive and forget. If you've read this far without deciding I'm being preachy or have gone on too many words in length, I've reached the end.

if fuel economy is your concern and you really don't care about acceleration then I would forgo the 2.0T. The top of the line Malibu with the 1.5 gets a little more that 10% better gas mileage and uses regular gas as opposed to premium for the 2.0T. not to mention saving several thousands on the MSRP.

It was a quick decision. I had stopped putting maintenance money onto the 1998 at about 150K miles thinking I'd trade or sell it real cheap to someone wanting to put a little money into repairs on a car they picked up really cheaply for a car to drive to work, e.g..

I'd have to go shop the various cars again like I've done since 2003 MY.

People have liked their Acuras and I'd have to study the options available. The negative is the store is a short trip across town. The folks that used to live across the street had Acuras but he bought them in Cincinnati or Columbus. Usually used. I like the premium interior described, although I haven't shopped one yet.

Also will check the Kia/Hyundai store. The local Tyota and Accord stores are nothing to brag about. I've seen a few Hyundai 80's and a couple of 90's. I might check out those as another premium vehicle like our Buicks used to be.

I told the owner of the local Chevy store that I didn't like the way Malibu is optioned to require the premium engine. The owner talks to customers in the wait room and the showroom. A real person, not fake like so many in their store commercials.

Plenty of reviewers have the 2.7 at under 6 secs. It is the reason I chose that engine.

and gross weight only matters when you max the payload, which isn't how they make 0-60 runs usually. The curb weight is 4500 lbs. Less than even my wife's minivan.

Here in Texas, if the insurance pays off on a flood damaged vehicle, it will (usually) be retitled with a “Salvage Title”. The title will not tell you why the vehicle was totaled by an insurance company, Carfax will often (but not always) show the reason.

There are people here in Houston who purchase cars at auction with relatively minor body damage, do the body work, and resell the cars not hiding the “salvage title”. They will usually have pictures showing the body damage before it was repaired, allowing you to judge for yourself how severe the damage was.

I have twice bought cars (one car, one truck, actually) that had salvage titles, but I saw proof of why they were “totaled” by the insurance company, so I knew exactly what I was getting into.

If there were no insurance on one of those cars in your picture, then it would not be “totaled”, and the title would not change to “salvage”. Those are the ones you have to worry about. One trick I was told about: pull off the inside door panel, and look for water marks inside the door.

When I was younger, back in the Paleolithic era, I had a couple of cars that were submerged in flood waters. These were beaters, no insurance, I dried them out and kept driving with no serious ill effects. But those cars had minimum electronics. No power windows, no power door locks, no power seats, no electronic ignition, no electronic fuel injection, no … Looking back now, I think the battery was just there for the starter and the headlights!
Great answer henryn. It seems there must be a huge number of cars with flood damage on the market these days. I bet a lot of private sellers get their cars that way.

Cars like that frequently end up on Craigslist.. The more honest sellers will list it as ""salvage"" if it hasn't been fixed and ""rebuilt"" if it went through some sort of repair. I know in NY such a car has to pass a specific state inspection before it can be registered. There's a national data base run by NICB where you can run a VIN check.

I hear that scammers will register such cars in non-title states like Vermont so that the branded status disappears.

I'd be very wary of a car like that unless it was dirt cheap. Especially a flood car.

You might find an older car that was totaled because of cosmetic damage like a sideswipe. If you could see before and after pictures it might reassure you. You'd still expect a discount over a compareable non accident car.

I've bought 5 cars off Craigslist and I never bothered with an independent inspection. Mostly it was because tbey were cheap (most expensive was $3500) but also because at that price point I expected to find $500-1000 in repairs required. I factor that into any offer.

Anything over 5k and I would get an independent inspection. Doing that doesn't guarantee perfection though.

There have been discussions here in these forums on that very topic, ""How much to discount a car for a Salvage title?"" A lot of people with a lot of different opinions, with no clear cut consensus. I think the closest thing to a real answer is, ""It depends.""

If you're looking at a 12 year old pickup truck that was totaled by the insurance company because it needed a new front bumper, grille, and hood (with no structural damage), and the clean value was $7,500, then the salvage value with the damage nicely repaired would probably be no more than 20% less.

A fairly new car, with a clean value of $25k, nicely repaired, would probably drop closer to 40%. YMMV

I think your chances are better of getting a good used car if it is bought from a new car dealer. New car dealers want to stay in business, want to have a good reputation, want to sell you a new car one day....and they have a lot invested and want to maintain their reputation.

*No car is 100% guaranteed from having problems. But a certified car has been gone over and checked, if the dealer is good questionable cars will go to auction or to an indie dealer. Seems dealers work with independents, makes dealing with an indie a bit more dicey since they are farther down the food chain.

The fellow who bought the Lexus bought it ""As Is"". He is a moron if he expected the dealer to fix the car. ""As is"" means NO WARRANTY - YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN. He probably got it for a good price, then expects a warranty too?

Agree with all of the above. I’ve had really good experiences buying used cars from a dealers lot. I still get them checked out, though! I remember buying a very used Mazda 626 hatch MT for my college son, and finding out upon inspection that the CV boots were leaking and needed replacing. The dealer did so and honored the price we had agreed on. Glad I had that checked out first though, because it ways definitely an AS IS car. Turned out to be a great buy and he drove it for several years.

The car would be given a thorough check by a mechanic, as suydam says. I'd ask several questions and be there during the check, too. Like I say, 51,000 miles on a 2013 Focus ST at a price of $12,500 is a really good deal. I've done my research on the car.

As far as religion goes, a lot of false preachers **cough**cough** like Catholics **cough**cough** have not followed the word of God, yet they claim to be authorities on the word of God. There will be double the punishment for them. Know that is true. I trust in my faith and I trust in the living God. I know that what I believe, he also believes. Enough so that I trust this guy selling the Focus ST. Besides, I would get the car checked out first. And his used car dealership has a great reputation in town. He's been in the business 26 years.

Having said all that, the car could have a failure of an expensive part at any time after I buy it. Just a part of the car business.

I had a positive little old lady story yesterday. Went to Paneras to get by breakfast sa dwich and as usual i get stuck behind an old woman buying begals one at a time. ""And I'll have a poppy seed fkr uncle Joe and I'll have ..."" you get the idea.

So after waiting behind her for forever they tell her the bill is $23.48 and she says ""but $23 is all I have"" and starts begging for a senior discount. This was all I could take and took out two quarters and placed them on the counter without saying anything. Suddenly I was her hero. All I wanted was to get my breakfast but I was her ""fairy godfather"".

Not sure how to take that but glad I could make some woman's day for 50 cents.
That would never happen to me because I don't like Paneras. I think they are over priced and I particularly don't like their bagels. As for the little old lady, I can't believe you let her con you like that. That's one of the oldest con schemes going. If you don't believe me get behind her again.

These cars are often moved into other areas. After the floods in Florida, Texas, and other areas, we get warnings here in flyover country from car folks about watching out for cars that have been moved here, where we don't expect to find flood damage.

Here in Texas, if the insurance pays off on a flood damaged vehicle, it will (usually) be retitled with a “Salvage Title”. The title will not tell you why the vehicle was totaled by an insurance company, Carfax will often (but not always) show the reason.

There are people here in Houston who purchase cars at auction with relatively minor body damage, do the body work, and resell the cars not hiding the “salvage title”. They will usually have pictures showing the body damage before it was repaired, allowing you to judge for yourself how severe the damage was.

I have twice bought cars (one car, one truck, actually) that had salvage titles, but I saw proof of why they were “totaled” by the insurance company, so I knew exactly what I was getting into.

If there were no insurance on one of those cars in your picture, then it would not be “totaled”, and the title would not change to “salvage”. Those are the ones you have to worry about. One trick I was told about: pull off the inside door panel, and look for water marks inside the door.

When I was younger, back in the Paleolithic era, I had a couple of cars that were submerged in flood waters. These were beaters, no insurance, I dried them out and kept driving with no serious ill effects. But those cars had minimum electronics. No power windows, no power door locks, no power seats, no electronic ignition, no electronic fuel injection, no … Looking back now, I think the battery was just there for the starter and the headlights!

Saw that storm...just hitting the tip if Florida more on the West side of the tip, then heading up to Fort Myers and then up the Gulf towards the western part of the panhandle.

I think a lot of stuff on those types of shows is made up stuff done for drama. They had to know about the asbestos issue, and as @snakeweasel said above, an inspection would have been part of the contract, as is customary. I think these home shows tell the people to be extra annoying, and to want the world in a house for little money. My wife watches these, and even she says they are mostly fiction. Reality is boring, and no one would watch if they didn't spice it up with fiction.
I sometimes watch those shows when I am exercising....doesn't require a lot of thinking or concentration. In every show they always hit some big unexpected snag....usually something they should have known about before remodeling the place. Like a wall ready to collapse, or termites, or a support beam right where they wanted to make it open.

I have only seen shows like that in doctor waiting rooms, but you reminded me of one that was on in my son's doc's waiting area a few weeks ago. They started tearing out a bathroom that had a tiled stall shower and they stopped and made a big deal out of the dividing wall having pipes in it. Really? If pipes in a shower surprise you, do you also think light bulbs are black magic? Maybe you shouldn't be remodeling a home but rather living in ""a home.""

Little old ladies pinching tomatoes in the grocery aren't nearly as scary.
I had a positive little old lady story yesterday. Went to Paneras to get by breakfast sa dwich and as usual i get stuck behind an old woman buying begals one at a time. ""And I'll have a poppy seed fkr uncle Joe and I'll have ..."" you get the idea.

So after waiting behind her for forever they tell her the bill is $23.48 and she says ""but $23 is all I have"" and starts begging for a senior discount. This was all I could take and took out two quarters and placed them on the counter without saying anything. Suddenly I was her hero. All I wanted was to get my breakfast but I was her ""fairy godfather"".

Not sure how to take that but glad I could make some woman's day for 50 cents.

I haven't gone to a movie in 20 years and don't expect that to change. What's interesting to me is to watch the promos from movies that cost big bucks to produce and disappeared without a trace, when I go into my DVR and watch a TV show that originally aired 2 or 3 years ago and see ads that aired when they premiered. The studios obviously spent many 10s of millions on these turkeys and the ads for them promised all sorts of thrills but the movie was an utter failure. Hard to determine why because it seems a majority of them all rely on the same formula of CGI special effects and cartoon-like characters instead of well-written scripts. Yet some make money and some flop. To me that is the biggest change in the movie business, the decline of writing and character-driven plots in exchange for increasingly complex special effects and visual stimulation. It has zero appeal to me.

That part is understandable, the Focus ST should be listed at $16,000, not $12,500. So I would have it checked out thoroughly first and enjoy a test drive, of course, and go from there.

The 2013 Ford Focus ST is a sort of available amusement while we enjoy the reliability and economy of our 2011 Kia Soul. I would rather have it sitting at a used car lot for sale 2 miles away than 1,000 miles away owned by someone else or listed for sale by someone else.

This is a continuing series which has been renewed.  Without giving it all away, it’s about a financial advisor who gets caught up in a Mexican Drug Cartel money laundering operation and how it affects/changes him and his wife and son and daughter.  I couldn’t keep count of the bodies.

No, this is a receiver I was using just fine for 3.5 years, and all of a sudden, the digital circuits when haywire.

I've isolated it to the digital processing.
Onkyo home theater receivers have a known problem with the ""hmdi board"". No sound will pass through any of the hdmi inputs until the receiver warms up. My Onkyo was several years old when it developed this problem. I have adapted (for the moment) by letting the receiver stay on continuously (volume all the way down).

The fix for the Onkyo costs $280 out of warranty. I've been looking on Craigslist for an alternate solution.



I have been called OCD by some people, but realistically, there are often workaround, everything doesn’t have to be perfect all of the time.

On my Kubota ZTR mower the charging circuit has stopped working. Not an easy fix, involves pulling the engine. I have discovered that I can use the mower for around 2 months at a time (around 45 minutes per week) before I need to charge the battery.

You left out cars jumping over other cars and sometimes school buses and yet they continue to out run the car that is chasing it or it is gaining on the car it is chasing. Way too much fairy tale stuff for me. And if you go to the movies to see these flicks, once you are turned off and don't want to be insulted anymore, it's way too loud to fall asleep and people wonder why I watch black and white reruns of Perry Mason on MeTV. I couldn't tell you the last time I watched a show on the major networks and just about everything I watch today is put on the DVR first, so I don't have to watch commercials, even the nightly news.

This has to be an age thing because I used to like going to the movies but then again I don't remember them trying to insult me very much. Even when watching the 007, Matt Helm and the In Like Flint movies.

My wife said she didnt want the stain warranty and we could pick it up ourselves (meaning I would have to load in and carry it into the house with someone I conned into helping me). We did like the sofa and were discussing it when the saleslady asked us what she could do to get us to buy. I told her if they threw in the warranty and delivery at no charge we had a deal.

They also had 18 months interest free financing which we took ( free money), and we will have it paid in 17 months. The only issue is that it's a brand new item not in stock yet so it will be 4 or 5 weeks before we get it.

Now last night at home my wife reviews the sales paperwork and starts complaining that they charged us for the warranty and the delivery. I said I know but they discounted the furniture price by the same amount to cover it so it effectively comes to free delivery and warranty.

I talk to the wife. and the dog. The dog likes me. my shadow.

No surprise, as your avatar shows a yellow lab. When I had a yellow lab, she was indeed my shadow anytime I was around the house. I'm thinking about getting another one, but I haven't decided about starting with a puppy or adopting a grown dog.

My remaining dog likes me, but doesn't follow me around. She spends a great deal of her time in the back yard, her choice as there is a dog door. My yellow lab also spent a fair bit of time outside, but only when I wasn't around.

On the work from home, I have found that it matters a great deal what kind of work you're doing. Before I retired the first time, I did a fair bit of work from home. But I was a programmer then, and needed very little interaction with others. Later on, I was the tech lead for some fairly large projects and had to be around to keep others on track. I really didn't like that, I preferred working alone, doing my own thing.

This time around, after coming back to work, I am doing software support. Installing, maintaining, providing first level support for petrotechnical applications, mostly on Linux, a few on Windows. There are two people in my group who work from outside the USA. They are knowledgeable, good workers, and try hard. But they cannot provide the same kind of support as someone who is on site. A lot of my help requests come when people come to my office, or stop me in the hallway, or talk to me in the break room.

I have been in this particular support position for almost 8 years now, and I find that the continuity is a big help. People know me, they know that I know my business, that they can depend on me to do my best to help, and that I will be straight with them.

Correct me if i'm wrong, isn't Ford just dropping sedans in the North American market? Won't they still be producing them for other markets? If so how hard would it be to transplant them here if need be.

One thing you have to realize that net profits don't tell the whole story. Financial statements can be influenced by write offs, one time payouts and a multitude of other things that you would have to look through the note to those financial statements. 
Of course, but footnotes are usually used to make the table to look better, not worse. If the main numbers are showing Ford spending billions, losing revenue, having high current debt positions (need to refinance soon), I can only imagine what footnotes would reveal. My point is Ford is visibly stressed and the stress seems to be raising due to the peak auto. At the same time Ford is spending large sums of money, presumably to improve its product and process, but this only increases overall risk, as cashlows seem to deteriorate due to makroeconomic concerns (peak auto). Therefore, the credit agency's downgrade with negative outlook does not seem to be unreasonable, even if it all turns to be ""nothing"" after all (which it may).

Even IBM almost bit the dust when they decided ""Who wants a personal computer in their HOME?""

I don't see Ford being that much of a Luddite. I'd be paying more attention to very large institutional investors, to see how they are behaving, not private investors who throw money in the Tesla Currency Furnace for instance. Tesla's stock price is absurd.

Ford is far from going under, but lowered credit rating simply reflects an opinion about the risk of not paying its all obligations in the future, including very distant one. It's usually based on stress scenarios, from global economic downturn, to country-specific issues and how it can affect overall company's ability to pay its current debt. Ford's profitability is currently under pressure, its models are old and tired (in comparison to say GM), its strategy appears a bit erratic (plans to ditch passenger cars from the US lineup have a smell of desperation, IMHO) and it did not ""enjoy"" a hard reset, GM had during bankruptcy. All these things are fixable, but require money, which Ford will have to borrow. However, we are on the other side of peak auto (which btw was delayed by one year due to Harvey/Irma), making payoff for those lineup investments even riskier. It already has high fixed costs, if the sales drop even more (say we go into more serious auto downturn due to saturation, or recession) and Ford is in the middle of big spending spree, the situation can get much more dicey for them. Rating agencies have to weigh those kind of risk scenarios and run stress-tests on finances of the companies before the actual stress happens.

To say, it will always work for them, because it did before, is ignoring the history. Graveyards are full of companies that did not survive the downturn, whether because of the cycle, or competition. How many car brands worldwide disappeared in last 30 years? How many of them changed owners, sold at the bottom, rather than top? Just recently, Opel was a German brand owned by an American company, since before World War II, I believe. Today it's a French owned company and who knows if they even keep it around. They have Peugeots, Citroens to sell and Opel/Vauxhall are in the same brand segments. The only reason to keep those would be to sell it to Germans, Brits (perhaps Australians, if French actually bought that, too), and certain Eastern Europeans, who won't buy French car. But I can see Opel/Vauxhall pulling from other markets, especially emerging markets in Africa and Asia, where Peugeot and Citroen have stronger presence and traditions from colonial times.

That dividend will be first thing to go (partially or fully), if finances deteriorate. All it takes is total US market losing sales of say million cars per year for couple of years and it can go very, very wrong. The fact, that the dividend went so high (due to the stock drop, not increases in the payment per share) is a signal that Mr. Market thinks it may be in danger.

I have a Thorens turntable, still. It’s not the one I originally had, but one I picked up used. I’ve rebuilt it and use it.

A vinyl setup isn’t for casual listening. Each album is 15-20 minutes per side. So, unless you are sitting in your chair, planning on flipping or digging through your vinyl collection for a longer term listening event, vinyl isn’t the format you want.

That said, there’s a certain satisfaction in digging through an album collection, finding long lost gems, cleaning the record, putting it on the turntable, lowering the tone arm/stylus and listening for several minutes. Did it all the time in college.

I probably should do that more often. But, I usually don’t and have to be in a “mood” to do it.

@graphicguy That describes it to a T. It's a relaxing thing and I enjoy the whole process around vinyl. But you do really have to be in the mood. And a glass of wine never hurts.

15.5 XC70 T6 / 16 Soul EV / 13 E350 Cabrio"
1564,August 30,dino001,"I just looked at basic financials of Ford:

1. Assets: $258B, Liabilities: $226B. It's positive, but if you consider that book value of an asset is not the same as a market value of one that has to be sold in distress (if that comes), this can be quickly flipped.
2. They have $115B in current assets (easy to liquidate at par value), vs. $152B in current debt, including long term debt that comes due, plus $22B accounts payable. This is not that pretty. Of course, they have huge cashflows, to cover a lot of those current payments, but they'll have to roll over a lot of debt soon.
3. They almost doubled their dividend this year - not very responsible move in light of peak auto, huge debt expenses. BTW, I was wrong about the source of that 6%+ dividend. It came not only from stock going down, it did come from the management raising it.

Income and cash flow statements do not look that great either:
1. Dividend is $1B+ per quarter ($4/year going out)
2. Quarterly cash flow dropped $1B y/y (15%), so did net income, also by $1B (but this is 50%). They made half of the profit with revenue lower by $1B than last year. BTW, they paid 40% less income tax in the same period. So: similar (but lower) revenue, lower taxes, half the net profit. Ouch.
3. They spend $17.5B last 12 months on capital expenditures, which is about 2.5 times their typical annual rate in last five years.
4. So, funny, that billion lost in revenue vs. last year is exactly billion lost in profit. So what happens if they lose another billion in revenue? Then the profit is zero. Another billion? You get the picture.

This goes on. No wonder credit agencies are not impressed. Again - this doesn't mean Ford is going under. It just means, it has much less room for an error and much more sensitivity to external issues and credit rating agencies had to weigh it all. It means Ford will pay more for its new debt and those who want out of its current bonds will have to take less. Does it mean the stock is a sell? Not necessarily, but beware for sure. Even if one believes it will be fine (and it may just be), one would be well advised not to put too much of their wealth into it right now.

That's how it used to be, but PSA came with brilliant idea to move Citroen into the lower segment. Completely ridiculous, IMHO. Citroen was in 60s one of the most innovative and forward thinking companies. Their cars were also beautiful. The buyer of course didn't care as much and they were eaten. PSA initially kept them in similar vein (I remember in 90s Citroen ZX, or something like that was still a great futuristically looking upscale sedan), but now they were diluted to the point that it's all about small subcompact segment, not the upscale limousine.

It's also an issue of nationalistic buyers in France and Germany (not much overlap). They (Opel vs. rest of PSA) compete quite directly in other countries, European or ROW, though.

It's probably about the price point that those vehicles could command in Europe. Opel was a real laggard vs. its peers in term of sales and appeal. Lots of aspirations, not a great execution, high German labor cost (at least on some models). To sell they had to price it below VW, even Ford. Astra could not touch Golf/Jetta or Focus, Corsa did even worse against Polo and Fiesta, Insignia (Buick here) was also relegated to fleet vehicle of a proverbial regional sales rep and lower middle manager. Fleet vehicle. This might not have been fair, but it was the fact of life.

I wonder if the profitability was achieved by better sales, or a flying axe.

In my business, the tariffs are being used to ""protect"" a domestic industry that is already damn close to a monopoly (the son of one company married the daughter of the other). It has put some very hardworking, honest, tax paying people out of business.

Even if not fully support, I can understand the sentiment. However, this can quickly escalate into something nobody remembers how it all started and nobody knows how to end.

Another thing, politicians, labor unions and managements of involved companies are often very disingenuous (to be charitable), when they cry foul over how foreign countries and their protections (that's not unique to America, of course, it's everywhere). Vehicles are actually a great example: everybody and their brother now knows how how unfair and evil European tariffs are on US passenger cars, but just mention to them ""chicken tax"" and see what they say... It is 25% duty on light trucks in force since 1964, which was imposed by the way in response on France's and Germany's tariffs on chickens (hence the name). Did you really think Big Three were this much better in SUVs and pickups than everybody else in the world, that was why nobody seriously challenged them for so long and everybody else making them uses facilities in the US (as opposed to cars, which often are imported)?
We can go industry, by industry - suddenly all that ""unfair"" foreign competition ""killing"" those oh-so-poor companies isn't so unfair after all. The old parable about seeing a grass in somebody's eye and ignoring the log in your own comes in mind.... For every bad tariff in EU we have our Chicken Tax, agricultural subsidy, or some other prohibition for foreign capital to start or purchase certain type of business in the US. It would be nice to make it all go away and let real advantages to play out, but it's not realistic to do it right away. We shouldn't believe (or at least be skeptical about) political/corporate talking points, or worse, completely uninformed spews from the Ignoramous. The truth is usually much more complicated by several orders of magnitude than 140 characters can ever express, even if they are dished out in series of twenties over the weekend. We should at least acknowledge that simple truth.

MAgnepans needed a lot of power. Plus, they were monoliths sitting in my “stereo” room, that were picky with speaker placement. But, when fed that power, and set up correctly, they truly enveloped you in sound....you could actually play each instrument in an orchestral piece listening to them. They’re still around by the way. They have their own Home Theater speakers today. I’d be anxious to hear what a rig like that sounds like. Unfortunately, unless you can go to their HQ in MN, you probably won’t find such a set up. I still keep track of them. I love their slogan....”Made in America.....Sold in China”!

Those Thorens turntables are beasts. And yes, with the re-birth of vinyl, can be worth a nice chunk of change.

That said, my Pioneer Elite AVR has more power, more processing, more compute power than anything I would have ever dreamed of back in my 2-channel audio days.

My Japan built Denon receiver is a paper weight right now because of poor customer service by Denon, and poor warranty support. It was over 3.5 years old when it started failing, so well past the 3 year warranty, but not that much past it. I got the feeling that the authorized service centers lacked confidence they had support for replacement parts in stock. I'd understand if it was 10 or more years old. I may have gotten a leftover, but still that puts it at no more than 6 years since release. The frustrating part is I know the amp section works, and the analog section works, it's obviously a problem with the digitial side of the receiver, it just can't play digital sources (but AM/FM, Analog RCA connected CD player works), HDMI/Optical doesn't.

Anyway, I never sold my slightly older HK 7550HD beast of a receiver. It's close to 50 pounds, and let me tell you, as good as the Denon was, it was a lightweight in the low 30 pounds area, and it shows when you listen to the Harmon Kardon's greatness. I'm very happy with the HK, and will use it until it has an issue.

Surprisingly, for some reason despite being a top notch high end receiver, it doesn't have a phono input for record players. The Denon had one, must be because of the more recent resurgence of vinyl. Turns out to be a blessing in disguise. I bought a little PROJECT phono preamp box for about $70 bucks, and it makes the built-in one on the Denon sound like absolute trash. Why include a built-in phono preamp if it's going to be garbage? Better to not include one, because the preamp really does make my records sound much better. A bad preamp in a $200 receiver makes sense, but in a $2,000+ (retail) receiver? I feel cheated by Denon. This $70 part shouldn't have made such a difference!

Regarding Sirius, I drew my line in the sand, and they chose to remain on the other side of it. Wasted 30 minutes of my life on the phone again with them, but this will be the last. I ended up cancelling service for the 2 cars that still had it.

They said the promotion I wanted (60 bucks for 1-year) was not available until tomorrow. I know Sirius' tactics, and I told them I wasn't calling back again tomorrow to waste more time, so do it now or lose me as a cutomer. They put me on hold for like 5 minutes, but came back to say they would not budge, I'm no longer a Sirius Customer, and I'm mad they wasted 30 minutes when I gave them the bottom line right at the start of the conversation on what it would take to keep me as a customer. Even worse, instead of saying the supervisor decided to say no to me, they mentioned another offer they were doing that was still on the other side of my line on the sand. As if I can't do the math and figure out they are making a worse offer than the previous one.

As far as I'm concerned, Sirius is a stain on humanity. I""m relieved to be done with them. I reluctantly stayed with them when bribed at $5/month, but I kept forgetting to renew on-time at 6 months, so the 1 year deal was a necessity as they gouge you upon renewal.

However, if they dare to call me tomorrow offering the deal they wouldn't do today, the offer was only good yesterday. Tomorrow my line in the sand is $55/year per car.

Ford Motor Company has survived since the Model T.  They even built bombers during WWII and even tanks.  I truly believe that Ford is versatile and agile as far as corporations go.  Yes, their stock is almost at junk status but Ford has something(s) up its sleeve.  No way is the family going to allow this great American company to go the way of others whose names have all but disappeared.

At $10 a share, I am sure the family is buying back shares in order to gain more of a foothold on where and how the company continues being a great manufacturing conglomerate.  If I was 15 years younger, I would be buying Ford stock at $10 a share - at least 10,000 shares.  Unfortunately, I am almost 74 years old and must maintain a conservative approach to money.  I am currently getting 2.5% on CD’s and Money Markets.  But at least it’s insured and safe.  I expect a return of 3% by the end of the year.  That’s a far cry from .08% which I got 1.5 years ago.

Yep, I would be buying Ford stock now if I was younger and still working.

Long ago, in a galaxy far far away, I owned a pair of Magneplanars. I drove them with an Adcom GFA-555. They were the replacement for a pair of Vandersteen 2Ce's. And the Magneplanars were replaced with a pair of Paradigm Elipse BP (bipolar) speakers, which I still have to this day. When I was still married, living in a big country house, I had a full 5 channel Paradigm setup. These days, I just use the one pair of speakers, driven by an Onkyo home theater receiver in 2 channel mode. I don't even use a subwoofer anymore, although I have 3 in storage. Those big Paradigm's don't need a subwoofer.
That’s some great gear.

I have a Thorens turntable, still. It’s not the one I originally had, but one I picked up used. I’ve rebuilt it and use it.

A vinyl setup isn’t for casual listening. Each album is 15-20 minutes per side. So, unless you are sitting in your chair, planning on flipping or digging through your vinyl collection for a longer term listening event, vinyl isn’t the format you want.

That said, there’s a certain satisfaction in digging through an album collection, finding long lost gems, cleaning the record, putting it on the turntable, lowering the tone arm/stylus and listening for several minutes. Did it all the time in college.

I probably should do that more often. But, I usually don’t and have to be in a “mood” to do it.

i just checked. It is under $10 per share (near a 52 week low) paying a 6.2% Dividend. Comparatively, Toyota is trading at a little over $125 per share (1/2 way between 52 week high & 52 week low) paying a 3.56% dividend. Interesting times we live in for sure.

1612,August 30,berri,"I think Ford will turn it around, but high dividends in a cyclical industry are something historically you want to be cautious about investing in. You may make a nice profit down the road, but holding it too long will often underperform over the years. More than a few bought classic conservative retire with stocks in the past when they were down and paying a nice dividend. Eventually they got burned. Think GE, Sears, even the grocer A&P years back. I've been looking at possibly buying a Ford Edge. Some good deals and it seems like a nice vehicle. I like it. My caution though isn't Ford going BK, it is the deal versus the depreciation. When you net it out, something like a Highlander ends up a better choice."

Even IBM, my former employer, has had a brush with death in the early 1990's. And, they are struggling now with this whole ""cloud"" approach and AI. Watson started out as a gimmick, then IBM has spent years trying to figure out how to monetize the research. Not going well, and IBM is laying off thousands of people in the process, even from companies that they recently purchased and were considered part of their new ""core"" businesses.

If Ford can't adapt to a changing market, or if they bet too big on strategies that don't pan out, I could see someone swooping in and buying the valuable assets (F-150) and discarding the rest.

My wife thinks a Tahoe looks like it has room to haul balloons, Hobby Lobby table decorations, some luggage for 2 or 3 and 2 or 3 passengers. May even bring back a large puppy on Sunday.

Is there one of the car rentals that will definitely deliver the vehicle type you ask for? Tahoe or GMC equivalent, I forget the name right now? Or do they tell you when you show up on the date that we have this or that which is sort of like it.

Are there other vehicles with similar hauling capacity I should accept or ask about when trying to make reservations?

I have access to Hertz and Enterprise off site and access to all the biggies on site at the local airport, Dayton International.

To summarize, if I want a Tahoe or GMC equivalent, who's most likely to deliver. And what are other options?

Pricing I've seen online is all over the map.
I can tell you that at most of our offices minivans are passed around like red-headed step children. I guess they are tough to rent. So assuming they have one in stock they should be glad to rent it. I don`t know about Enterprise but when I tried to rent the new style Mustang in 2005 it was like pulling teeth to get that specific car. Remember most of the off brand companies are owned by either Enterprise or Hertz.

1666,August 29,abacomike,"Yesterday, I went over to the mortuary that handled my Dad’s cremation and internment at the South Florida National Cemetary in order to ascertain the approximate cost of prearranging what happens to my remains, etc.  Let’s face it, it’s better to take care of this before rather than after because I don’t want my kids to have to deal with it.

I walked in the main entrance and immediately got nauseated by the heavily “perfumed” odor of the entire place.  Luckily I was met by a funeral director who saw I was struggling with the “aroma” and immediately led me to his office where he closed the door and handed me a packet of smelling salts.  After a few minutes I was able to recover mainly because his office didn’t smell of perfume and the fact that the smelling salts enabled me to get my wits about me.  This is not a great place to visit if you are alive and “breathing”!

I explained that I wanted to prepay my final arrangements so my children wouldn’t have to.  I explained that there was an empty grave next to my mom and it was free and clear.  I also explained that I didn’t want a fancy or expensive memorial service or funeral.  So he showed me “economical” final arrangement options which, for the most part, amounted to over $8000 for everything including the hearse, a cheap pine casket stained to look like oak, the visitation, the 50+ mile trip to the gravesite and police escort.  There was even a charge for digging the grave.

I asked if there was a “less expensive way to leave behind my loved ones” and he said he could eliminate floral arrangements as well as the evening before memorial service.  I said fine.  He said that brought the cost down to $7300.  

I finally asked if it would be less expensive to have me cremated and my ashes put in a cardboard box and placed a couple of feet below the surface of my grave with no funeral, no hearse, no memorial service, etc.  He said the cemetary requires the standard opening of the grave, casket or ashes - as well as a foot stone marker - so it didn’t matter.  The cost would be $2900, but he urged that I get an urn for my children’s sake and eliminate burying the ashes at the cemetery.  I could immediately envision them both fighting over who would be lucky enough “to not have to” accept my remains.

I told the funeral director thanks and that I wanted to think this over.

He gave me another packet of smelling salts in order to get to my car without heaving or passing out and I walked to the front entrance holding my breath all the way.  When I got home, I called the Neptune Society and signed up for a bargain basement cremation with my ashes spread on the Atlantic Ocean.  At least I could end it all by feeding the fish!

I compared the same songs on SirusXM on our Malibu 250 W Pioneer with mp4 on CD and mp4 on USB. The USB sounded better. I was curious if the playback on the CD degrades the sound a little bit compared to the direct reading of 0's and 1's on the USB?

Did you literally mean ""mp4"" or did you mistype ""mp3""? The *.mp4 file extension is generally used for videos, and the embedded audio in an mp4 is usually aac. If you're ripping your cd's to play them back on your phone or in your car, then you usually have a choice of mp3 or aac. The aac encoder is newer and more efficient, it is what Apple uses. And the file extension used if you choose aac encoding will be ""*.m4a"".

On the CD versus USB playback, there should be no real difference as long as we're talking the same mp3 file, just stored on a different medium. If we're talking an original store bought audio cd, then yes, that is a higher quality source, and you may hear the difference. Double blind listening tests don't usually bear that out, but ...

Now there are some audio purists (the same ones who claim vinyl sounds better than digital) who will talk about ""jitter"" and such when you are playing back music from an optical disk (CD). In the real world, that isn't likely to matter. Unless your CD is scratched up and the CD player has a hard time reading the 0's and 1's.

I told this story before so here's the condensed version:

When working on a particular stretch of road I would always pull the accident statistics. Many times there were an unordinary amount of ""excess speed"" causes. I asked a state trooper why and he said something about when they don't know what caused the accident they check the excess speed box. Makes sense since they have to check some box, but misleading.
Not to mention that with the US's penchant for under-posting speed limits, the majority will always be technically speeding a majority of their driving time. It doesn't take an Albert Einstein to figure out how that might skew the results when you define speeding as ""excess speed.""

I have a very good customer who is a complete MOPAR Encyclopedia. He recently placed ""top 5"" at MOPAR Nationals in Ohio. I told him about your overheating problem and what you have done to the Dodge so far. He came up with a few suggestions (which you may or may not have tried):

-Timing should be set to 35 degrees Top Dead Center
-Distributor should be pointing to the #1 Cylinder (it could fit on properly, but be off 180 degrees)
-A tooth on your distributor could be off
-Make sure the firing order is correct in the distributor cap
-Make sure the timing chain is lined up properly
-Aluminum radiators require special ""Aluminum Compatible Coolant.""
-Your distributor gear could be in wrong
-Thermostat could be bad, old, or incorrect
-The Heads/Valve Springs/Cam all have to match up (High lift cams require different valve springs)
-The Damper needs to be lined up
-The line on the harmonic balancer needs to match up with the timing chain
-Have you replaced the head gaskets? They need to be installed correctly (left & right). If they are installed upside down, they will fit, but maybe block a port.

He had a few questions that I couldn't answer regarding your over heating issue:

Does it run hot when you are idling or when you take it out on the road?

Does it run hot & bad (sputter, sound like it is choking...) or just hot?

When you bought it, did it run correctly? Was it overheating when you bought it? Has this over heating issue started when YOU changed something?

If you have any, specific questions, I'll be glad to call him and ask him for you and will show him pictures if you'd like to send me (he doesn't have a cell phone or email).

Please thank your friend for me.
As I put it back together, most of this will be checked. I also might as well replace my head gaskets, although I ran a test through the radiator and it checked out as having no exhaust gases leaking in.
I couldn't say if it always overheated because the temp gauge didn't work and it threw the fan belt on my first extended drive, at which point it really did overheat and need to be towed. After that, I installed aux gauges to monitor the temp among other things.
Runs fine, just hot. And only when driving. It will idle forever and not get too hot.

They are single disk players. My last car to have a 6-CD changer was the Accord, 2003 model right on the center dash. I'd agree that a 6-disc changer would make the glove box a more appropriate location. I don't want a changer though, a single disc player is good enough, but it takes so little room, they should just make a skinny slot in the dash. On the bright side, the sound quality of the disc player is excellent. Really shows how Sirius is limited in bandwidth and bit rate.

Not by me, but one day I foresee a driver suing VW/Audi for a collision caused by trying to get a CD in the slot of the glove compartment while driving. Exhibit 1 for the defense will probably be a caution/danger box in the owner's manual saying to not do exactly that.

As I put it back together, most of this will be checked. I also might as well replace my head gaskets, although I ran a test through the radiator and it checked out as having no exhaust gases leaking in.
I couldn't say if it always overheated because the temp gauge didn't work and it threw the fan belt on my first extended drive, at which point it really did overheat and need to be towed. After that, I installed aux gauges to monitor the temp among other things.

My suggestion to determine if the thermostat is suspect, is to remove it altogether and see what happens. This simulates a woking thermostat at full operating temps. If you still have the problem without the stat you have eliminated one possible problem. Again, just a suggestion.

No, it most definitely does not rule that out. Kinda makes me wonder, too. Cooling system problems (clogged up radiator for instance) would tend to show up during extended idling.

I have seen or read a number of complaints, people claiming that satellite radio was compressed more and sounded worse than MP3 music. To my ears, it sounds fine. The Wikipedia page for XM satellite radio states they store their music library in aac format at 384 kbit/s, which is indeed very high quality. However, they apparently dynamically allocate bandwidth on the fly so the signal you actually get will be less.

To the technically uninitiated, aac is newer and better than mp3, giving better results in a smaller size / lower bitrate.

1707,August 28,graphicguy,"I bemoan the exit of the CD slot. In Acuras (as well as some others), they served as a playback device in my car for hi Rez audio. I have a bunch of really good, multi-channel disks on DVD-Audio and DTS. Now, in the current Acura, the slot only plays regular CDs and DTS disks. So, I keep my DVD-Audio listening for home.

I don’t know about planned obsolescence, but if you look at the trajectory, ‘50s through the ‘70s saw analog vinyl rise. Late ‘70s through the ‘80s it was the cassette tape. Mid-‘80s CDs happened along through the ‘00s. From the time the iPod/iPhone was released (2010 or thereabouts), music on a small device became a reality in conjunction with peer-to-peer file sharing (music files, mainly).

Currently, the streaming services are in their heyday. But, once again, vinyl has made a comeback presumably because it sounds better (no real proof of that).

So, each format had about a decade of popularity, some had more longevity and popularity than others.

I’m sure if you had told the music industry that planning the obsolescence of the CD (which, in part, led to peer-to-peer music sharing like NAPSTER), they never would have planned it. That leads me to believe it was just technology marching on that caused all of these new formats.

I have a very good customer who is a complete MOPAR Encyclopedia. He recently placed ""top 5"" at MOPAR Nationals in Ohio. I told him about your overheating problem and what you have done to the Dodge so far. He came up with a few suggestions (which you may or may not have tried):

-Timing should be set to 35 degrees Top Dead Center
-Distributor should be pointing to the #1 Cylinder (it could fit on properly, but be off 180 degrees)
-A tooth on your distributor could be off
-Make sure the firing order is correct in the distributor cap
-Make sure the timing chain is lined up properly
-Aluminum radiators require special ""Aluminum Compatible Coolant.""
-Your distributor gear could be in wrong
-Thermostat could be bad, old, or incorrect
-The Heads/Valve Springs/Cam all have to match up (High lift cams require different valve springs)
-The Damper needs to be lined up
-The line on the harmonic balancer needs to match up with the timing chain
-Have you replaced the head gaskets? They need to be installed correctly (left & right). If they are installed upside down, they will fit, but maybe block a port.

He had a few questions that I couldn't answer regarding your over heating issue:

Does it run hot when you are idling or when you take it out on the road?

Does it run hot & bad (sputter, sound like it is choking...) or just hot?

When you bought it, did it run correctly? Was it overheating when you bought it? Has this over heating issue started when YOU changed something?

If you have any, specific questions, I'll be glad to call him and ask him for you and will show him pictures if you'd like to send me (he doesn't have a cell phone or email).

As for vinyl sounding better some actually did. It really depended on the quality of the production and how new the record was. DMM (Direct Metal Mastering) records had absolutely excellent sound quality that matches anything today. The main issue with vinyl is that everytime you played a record the needle would cause wear on the grooves that would eventually reduce the sound quality. Back in the 80's and 90's when I got a LP the very first time I played it I recorded it on cassette and used the cassette to listen to music only playing the LP to record it when the cassette went bad.

Then Napster came along and they fought that. They seemed totally incapable of adapting to the new tech for a long time. Add to that the decline of radio importance in popularizing music and artists, the decline in album purchasing which severely cut into the profitability of labels, and the music industry is a shell of what it once was.

Back around 1977 one of my coworkers gave me a 1970 Dodge Challenger convertible. It had been sitting in his garage for 2 years, the story was he paid a shade tree mechanic to rebuild the engine and it was “never right afterwards”. He was getting married, his new wife wanted to park in the garage, the non-running convertible had to go.

The paint was in bad condition, the carpet was shot, but the top still seemed okay and the tires were at least holding air. I borrowed a trailer, loaded it up, and hauled it up to the small town in East Texas where I was born and raised, about 75 miles north of Houston. My father had his own independent service garage, and allowed me to use his facilities. It took very little to get the car started and running, the old 318 V8, very reliable. But it had a strange overheating problem. Very strange indeed. I fooled around, trying to figure it out, and the passenger side head cracked. Really unusual, my father with more than 30 years experience had never seen anything like it.

I pulled the engine out and started tearing it down for a complete rebuild. Lo and behold, when I removed the water pump I found a freeze plug in the circulation hole or port on the passenger side behind the water pump. The side where the head had cracked. Obviously, the shade tree mechanic had inserted a freeze plug where it did not belong.

I’ll bet even the “car doc” would have had a very hard time diagnosing that one without tearing down the engine.

A fair number of accidents are related to driver competency level and that's almost impossible to blend into the statistics. For one person, a speed of 85 mph is a big nothing; for another person, it's potentially lethal.

I had a pretty nice analog set up with one of my first “real” jobs that paid “real” money after I graduated in the ‘80s. I think I probably had $4,000-$5,000 in that rig, which today is....what?.....$10K? Maybe $12K in todays money.

I had a nice Carver amp driving some Magnepan speakers with a Thorens turntable. My whole living room was considered the “stereo room”. I think I bought the first CD player in the little town I was living in at the time. Cost easily $1,200, but after I heard a demo, it was a no brainer. No pops, clicks, hiss and a signal to noise ratio better than anything I had ever heard before. I still remember the first disks I heard were.....Paul Simon’s “Graceland” and ‘Till Tuesdays “Welcome Home”. I was stunned.

I spent the next 10 years replacing my vinyl with CDs. Some of the remasteres were good....some not so much, and the vinyl was better, even with the hiss, pops, cracks and poor signal to noise.

A colleague at the time, had even more money invested in his vinyl system....two Conrad Johnson monoblocks, QUAD ESL speakers, a Linn turntable with a cartridge that cost $1,000 alone (remember these were ‘80s dollars). He spent more on cables than I did on my wardrobe. It indeed sounded spectacular.

He came over to listen to the new CD player I had. He bought the exact same one I had the very next day and began selling off his analog system over the next year.

Ah...the memories of being young and frivolous. Priorities changed real quick after that....wife....kid.....no more stereo expenditures.

When Edmunds did their not so seamless system change, I decided to just sit on the couch in the family room and use my dumb phone to sign up to the new Insider thingy and not go upstairs to do it on my PC in the office. For a while I thought I paid for that laziness but not really.

Let me back up for just a minute. Even before the Insider thingy, Edmunds had an incorrect email for me that I tried to change at least a dozen times over the years with no success. Finally I just gave up and when something glitched either with my hardware or Edmunds old system and I got the ""Howdy Stranger"" pop up page, I just had to remember the incorrect email address and enter it along with my user name. It always worked and I got in here so I just kept doing it like that whenever something glitched.

Then came the glorious change over so I figured once and for all I'll use my correct email but of course I'd use my same user name (@jmonroe). Sounded very logical to me but now Edmunds gave me a pop up box saying someone already had that user name (and I knew who that was) so rather than fight it I chose @jmonroe1.

Now for some confusion. When I went to the office later that day and logged in here, I see that Edmunds still recognized @jmonroe (the one and only original). Knowing now what happened when I did the switchover with my phone, I just let it alone using the old adage, ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"".

I know that sooner or later my PC or Edmunds will glitch and probably won't recognize the @jmonroe guy anymore so I'll have to go with @jmonroe1 on my PC also when that happens. But until that happens you'll see me both ways.

Also, even before the change over, Edmunds changed my mug shot and then changed it back again. If you guys remember, the original @jmonroe mug shot was a smiley green faced guy but now I'm a smiley red faced thing. The mug shot assigned to @jmonroe1 is a blank staring red faced guy with glasses. FWIW, neither of these mug shots look like Dean Martin. BTW, I see your mug shot has also changed.

I can’t remember whether I have told this story here before, so here goes.

Back around 1977 one of my coworkers gave me a 1970 Dodge Challenger convertible. It had been sitting in his garage for 2 years, the story was he paid a shade tree mechanic to rebuild the engine and it was “never right afterwards”. He was getting married, his new wife wanted to park in the garage, the non-running convertible had to go.

The paint was in bad condition, the carpet was shot, but the top still seemed okay and the tires were at least holding air. I borrowed a trailer, loaded it up, and hauled it up to the small town in East Texas where I was born and raised, about 75 miles north of Houston. My father had his own independent service garage, and allowed me to use his facilities. It took very little to get the car started and running, the old 318 V8, very reliable. But it had a strange overheating problem. Very strange indeed. I fooled around, trying to figure it out, and the passenger side head cracked. Really unusual, my father with more than 30 years experience had never seen anything like it.

I pulled the engine out and started tearing it down for a complete rebuild. Lo and behold, when I removed the water pump I found a freeze plug in the circulation hole or port on the passenger side behind the water pump. The side where the head had cracked. Obviously, the shade tree mechanic had inserted a freeze plug where it did not belong.

I’ll bet even the “car doc” would have had a very hard time diagnosing that one without tearing down the engine.
I agree with you about the @cardoc but I'm sure he'd be the first to tell you that you created that problem because a ""professional"" wasn't used to do the work.

You can adjust when it flashes. So rather than guessing how far before TDC the mark is when it flashes, you can adjust the pulse until the mark is back to zero and the digital readout tells you how many degrees before or after TDC it is. What is silly about the Dodge is that the timing marks only go to 10 degrees BTDC, yet you need around 30 ""all in"" around 2500 rpm. No way to measure that with a standard light other than guesstimating or going ghetto and putting the timing tape on the damper.

When working on a particular stretch of road I would always pull the accident statistics. Many times there were an unordinary amount of ""excess speed"" causes. I asked a state trooper why and he said something about when they don't know what caused the accident they check the excess speed box. Makes sense since they have to check some box, but misleading.

Bisbee is also the setting of Sheriff Joanna Brady activities in books by Janice Jance. Lots of local color is contained in the book as Sheriff Brady goes about solving crimes and living her everyday life. Actually I'd like to visit that area.

I subscribed to Arizona Highways long ago. It contained beautiful pictures of Arizona. It would have been nice to see them in person.

Recently this pic posted on Shorpy.com showed part of Bisbee in 1941. The ""family liquors"" signage fascinated me. Also some interesting pre-war cars to try to ID:

1777,August 27,henryn,"Speaking of SiriusXM, I just got my Amex bill and found a charge for $122.25 to SiriusXM, made on 7/26/2018. I obviously failed to get ahead of that one, my mistake. They used to notify me in advance before they auto-renewed, but that seems to be no longer true.

So I called them on the phone and gave them some h-e-double-l for not notifying me in advance, asked to cancel, got switched to customer retention, and wound up paying $42.05 for the next 6 months. But I am on the hook $21 for this last month’s service, no way out of that, water under the bridge.

Next, I called Amex and asked them why I wasn’t notified of the charge. I have my account set to notify me of all charges where the credit card is not present, and normally Amex is quite good about that. The answer is they don’t notify you of a recurring payment, the company doing the recurring payment is supposed to notify you. Which of course, SiriusXM did not do, being the sneaky underhanded business that they are. So I have this in my calendar now for Feb 25, 2019 (2 days before the next renewal.

I hate SiriusXM. Or, more correctly, I hate their business practices, but like their product. And of course they have no real competition, unless you want to subscribe to a streaming service on your phone (which I don’t really want to do). Not nearly as convenient as the built in SiriusXM in new cars.

Hmmm… If I were to go over to a streaming service (spotify, or whatever) – do they have “channels” like SiriusXM? With Android AutoPlay, do you get the same information on your dash as you do with SiriusXM (song title, artist, etc)?

One thing I will give them credit for though. During the time I had it I found I only listened to a few channels regularly, Classic Rewind, 80s on 8 and a couple of others. I also found their playlists were not particularly deep, so you would hear many of the same songs with some frequency if you stayed with it long enough. I learned from those things that I liked certain songs or artists I had forgotten about, and was sick of some others. I used that knowledge when I was building my music library and playlists to put on a USB stick that now has taken their place in my car. Do not miss SXM one little bit.

Are you sure that your vehicles don't have a CD player? It won't be obvious, just a small horizontal slot. Take a look next time you're in your car, I think you will find it.

I do agree that they are not used much anymore, I can't remember the last time I used one.

Last year I was traveling up highway 290 (the northwest freeway going out of Houston). 290 has been in a semi-permanent state of being rebuilt for more years than I can remember. All of the old exits had been closed or demolished, and the new temporary exits were few and far between (and often not marked at all). You had to guess where you were, and which exit to take. And if you skipped this one, it might be 4 or 5 miles before you got another chance. Lots of fun.

So I was using google maps, which kept telling me, ""take a right turn onto exit 47a. Turn now."" Only, of course, exit 47a had been demolished the week before, and taking a right turn would have been calamitous.

You mentioning the drilling reminded me of a story I read in the book ""Ball Four"" by Jim Bouton. A catcher got hit on the fingernail and the team doc determined the nail had to be drilled to relieve the pressure. Bouton talks about how he and others stuck around to watch and how the drill must have been dull because the bit wouldn't go thru the nail. Finally when it hit paydirt the catcher jerked his hand away and the drill came with it, stuck in the finger. Ouch.

When I was on the service (a Hospital Corpsman) to relieve pressure under a nail we would straighten a paperclip, heat up one end and use the heated end on the nail to burn through the nail.

I have seen that treatment performed twice. The first time was when Son #1 was a toddler and dragged out Mrs. j's 12 inch by 12 inch by 1 1/2 inches thick maple cutting board from under the kitchen sink and dropped it on the big toe of his left foot. Took him to the pediatrician and the doctor laid him on his work bench, straightened out a paper clip, heated it with a match and melted through his toe nail. Worked liked charm.

The second time was when I whacked my left thumb with a hammer while I was playing carpenter one Saturday. Hurt like hell and got worse as the day progressed. By about midnight I had enough and decided to go to the hospital. The emergency room doctor took one look at my thumb and said, ""I have a fix for that, you're gonna feel a lot better in a minute"". He got out a paper clip and used a Bunsen Burner to heat it up and when he melted through the nail, my thumb felt better instantly, but it was a little humorous to see the fountain of blood dance up and down a few times as the pressure was relieved. I remember saying to the doctor that I expected a little more sophisticated treatment from a hospital to which he said, ""Why? This has probably been done for centuries. If it ain't broke we don't fix it. I couldn't begin to tell you how many times I've done this"".

@suydam , this was the latest series from Tom Hanks & co. who had done a pretty good job with their past series on decades.

1841,August 26,iluvmysephia1,"As for favorite decades for music, the 60's were a bit folksy for me. Sure there were the Rolling Stones and Beatles, the continuation of Chuck Berry and Elvis, and man when Jimi Hendrix came along and played some serious plugged-in electric guitar, it spurred on Eric Clapton and the rest to plug in and ROCK like rock should be played.

My first concert that I went to was Carole King and James Taylor round about 1971. Loved it! The next show was Rod Stewart and Faces. Whoa! Loud rock and roll. In 1974 I went to go see Foghat at Hec Edmundson Pavilion at the U of Washington. Double, triple WHOA. Loud and bluesy rockin' that got my feet a movin'. Same thing with Burton Cummings and The Guess Who. Burton's great voice and piano combined with catchy love songs made them my 2nd favorite band, following only Foghat as my favorite band. I didn't discover Canada's Tragically Hip until 1997 - once Gordon Downie's catchy-rowdy vocals and the band's great guitar and drumming became entrenched in my mind, that band became locked in to my 3rd spot for all-time favorite rock bands.

I think the 60's were too cutesy, the 80's too detached and weird sounding for the most part. My fave decade for rock and just great music in general was the 1970's. I don't even have to think about it much, but since I love 70's music so much, I will.

1848,August 27,ab348,"Dodged a bullet (sorta) today. About a month ago I had to buy a new hedge trimmer as the old one gave up the ghost. The new one is considerably lighter than the former, so it is easier to use overhead on tall shrubs, etc. I was doing that and reached up with it in one hand, then went to put a second hand on it, and missed both the handle and the guard somehow. My right index finger got pinched by the bar, thankfully not all the way in but just on the outside of the bar where the blades are angled away.

I was wearing gloves and and they weren't cut so aside from the pinch didn't think anything of it. But it kept throbbing so after a minute I took a look and saw that it had cracked the fingernail partway down in the middle and it was bleeding underneath. I think the nail actually was what caused the cut under it. Blood was seeping quite a bit so I went inside to try to apply some antiseptic and try to get it stopped. That took a while as it was stubborn. Finally got several bandaids arranged on it to abate it and went back out to clean up. A couple of hours later I gripped something and it started bleeding again, so a new regime of bandaids was pressed into service. So far so good ever since. It is in a spot where it is easy to disturb so I am trying to be careful. Just glad it wasn't a lot worse.

1854,August 27,driver100,"You learn something every day:
To determine how many clowns can fit in the car, it’s simple math. It’s a volume calculation. An American Standard Clown (ASC) is 5’ 8” tall and weighs 158 pounds. Each clown takes up approximately 3 cubic feet of space. A completely bare clown car probably has about 120 cubic feet of total space for clowns. So about 40 clowns should be able to fit in a clown car. But there are other factors, such as clowns need to breath, the need to exit the car quickly, and the use of props. Therefore, a typical clown car fits between 14 and 21 clowns with their props.

Part of the reason is the music itself. I recognize I am now an old guy and the music one grew up with is what you tend to like, but the industry is a shell of what it once was and most of the stuff produced these days is crap I do not enjoy. Last night I watched CNN's ""The 2000s"" series episode ""I Want My MP3"" about music in that decade and it was just depressing. Between the talking heads they had on saying how this or that hip-hop performer or that producer was groundbreaking I just had to shake my head. But it got no better when they went into other performers in the decade like Arcade Fire, Taylor Swift and then things like Deadmau5. A couple of years ago one of the ""progressive"" local pols convinced the city to book Deadmau5 for the annual Natal Day (municipal birthday) summer concert, which is usually a family event. The grounds filled and people over 30 in the audience for the most part were absolutely baffled. The world has changed and I no longer want to listen to it.

The 70's didn't just spawn disco, it brought back country rock and brought in the emerging power rockers and ballads like Journey or Foreigner for example. Much better decade than the Top 40 stuff makes many people think...and this is coming from someone who grew up in the 60's, although personally I do prefer that decade overall."

For new music, I mostly tolerate only electronic material (there's a Sirus channel for that, too) - I can safely say plenty of people over 30 listen to Deadmau5, at least on the west coast.
I listened to some of it and for all the world it sounds like the early computer ""music"" (really just a sequence of sounds) people used to play with on PCs in the '80s and early '90s.

1881,August 26,fintail,"I think there are several Sirius channels for various forms of classic rock - not my thing though. I'd actually rather listen to disco - it's good for driving, and can be funny - but I am too young to remember it being a trend, and the eventual backlash against it, so maybe I have rose-tinted thoughts. For the power rockers, I like the 80s more - I can remember some of that. The 80s themed Sirius channel has a lot of sometimes dull Top 40 content too, but sometimes a gem slips through. With 20 presets and steering wheel controls, flipping through the channels is easy.
berri said:
I think rock music broke off into a lot of segments in the 70's, so besides the 70's channel that reflects the Top 40 portion, you probably also need a classic rock station to hear some of the other stuff from that decade. The 70's didn't just spawn disco, it brought back country rock and brought in the emerging power rockers and ballads like Journey or Foreigner for example. Much better decade than the Top 40 stuff makes many people think...and this is coming from someone who grew up in the 60's, although personally I do prefer that decade overall."

There’s a lot of great music nowadays and a lot of junk too, same as always. For one thing, there’s much more Western exposure to African, Caribbean, and Latin sounds, so there’s a lot more interesting sounds possible.

The front moonroof opens all the way in my car - but the rear moonroof is sealed.  The rear passenger has a switch on either rear door that, when pressed, opens the rear top screen to allow sunlight in and enables the rear passengers to see out.  There are two audio speakers in the roof between the two moonroofs which are used as part of the surround sound system.

The only time I have opened the front moonroof is during the winter and spring months.  But I agree Shifty that the wind noise can be a bit obtrusive.

I believe the harness was fixed after it went into GM's possession for a while. IIRC it appeared it was titled in Columbus by corporate GM. The title states that the vehicle is a buy back. It's likely being driven by someone enjoying a very nice vehicle.

@driver100 The title did not show up anywhere else. Not on a car sale site nor a lender's site as did the other VIN.

I do not have interest in going state by state to see if they offer a way for the public to search VIN the way Ohio does.
There may be information on CarFax if anyone has a full subsrciption amd wants to check for it. And there may be data on some of the pay sites that sell information aggregated from all states. Is Manheim the name of the car auction data that some use to get a realistic value for cars for those in the business? They might have had it go through there. But I reached the proverbial dead end.

Nowadays, I hardly see convertibles down here.  I believe it is due to the higher incidence of skin cancer and the fact that May through late October, it’s just too darn hot and humid.  Even at night, our lows are in the low 80’s and very humid.

Could be a combination of reasons;
Air conditioning is more dependable and is less expensive,
Many people don't want to be out in the sun unnecessarily,
There was something romantic and a convertible denoted status....not anymore
We have learned, a convertible isn't all that it is cracked up to be.
Only 10% of convertible buyers, buy a second one.

There are about 6 times a year when conditions are perfect for having a convertible, is it worth it to put up with all of the disadvantages for those 6 days? Under ideal conditions a convertible is great.....the rest of the time more disadvantages than advantages.

Odd because most ""experts"" say the IRS won't call you. They will send a letter first. However, On tax forms, including a 1040x I just filed, they want your phone number... So if they have questions about the 1040x simple change during the 16 weeks they say it can take to process a 1040x are they going to call me? (17 weeks? What are they doing that they can't do a reprocess of a simple individual return.)

When we bought the 2014 Malibu in March of 2014, the first drive we took was to Columbus for lunch with our OSU student son, and the phone in the car rang. I had just gotten on I70. After I figured out how to answer, it was an IRS scam call. never got another phone call on that number while the OnStar was active.
Did you see the quotes in the IRS People? Of course IRS doesn't call you about your bad return, but sends you a letter first. It's the Nigerian, Indian, or home grown scam artists calling you to scare you that the Sheriff is on his way to arrest you, if you don't respond now.

In the old days of paper returns, I heard of people who were called legitimately, but only if they forgot a signature, or had some other technical issue with the forms. Essentially a courtesy call from the IRS to help you avoid late filing penalties, if you act. Those filing electronically would not experience that, as return gets rejected if there is something wrong with the technicals (e.g. wrong PIN) and you get an email. If there are actual questions about the income, deductions, etc. then you get letters, not phone calls.

By the way, three years ago somebody tried to file a return on my name (scamming a large refund, of course), but the IRS caught it themselves and rejected it. There was still some extra work, though. I couldn't file electronically that year, had to send a paper return with an affidavit, report the crime at my local sheriff's office. However, I still got the refund money fairly quickly, in couple of months. Since then they send me PIN valid for a particular tax year and now I can file electronically again. My colleague had similar problem and he still had an unresolved return after a year.

Without bringing politics into the thinking please,
what do folks here who invest in equities and cash equivalents feel about the markets for the next many months?

Any ideas? I do hear financial commentators say another rate hike by the independent Fed will bring the rates into what's considered the normal range for first time in 10 years approx. Rates being in that position allows the Fed to raise or lower rates to control the economy.
I don't know what happens in next months. However, I know that no matter who was in power or what the economic policies were, if you take any 20-year period, stock market beats every market class. Take a 20-year ruler and slide it along the time line on Dow or S&P500 chart and you'll see it. This means of course that fortunately, so those two parties differ by a lot, yet not that much after all, in the grandest scheme of things. We didn't have anybody like Chavez or Mugabe in power, thank God (those numbers would have been different then). At least until now and let's how it stays that way.

So I'm not concerned about next rate hike, or next ""correction"" (BTW, why do we call a fall correction? What's so ""correct"" about a fall vs. raise, especially if the natural move is actually up?) or even ""bear market"". My accumulation and return period is still over 20 years.

Now, about rates - it's about time. I think it was quite unfair to punish savers in favor of spenders and deadbeats (this is a ""color"" commentary, I know it's more complicated than that) for this long. It's really not a matter of market returns, it's about fairness.

I've had my retirement account parked in (low) interest-bearing securities ever since the last blip in the spring. Now I know the markets have recovered all that and more in the months since, but that's OK. I feel there is a big correction due soon.
I heard today that analysts say there is still 25-50% possible upside before the market turns. My money is in the same value type mutual funds that pay 2-5% dividends for the last 9 years. Since I retired we take the dividends instead of reinvesting them. My investments don`t have the big up side potential but they don't drop as much in pullbacks.

A few observations (by others):
1. Markets go up further then they fall, but they fall much faster than they climb.
2. Markets go up higher than we think is possible and they fall lower than we can imagine.

General dividend strategy is good, but one has to recognize dividends are not equal. You may have a hard reset in some industries that pay good dividends for a period of time, but face hardship. Oil companies recently. Essentially anybody who is highly cyclical (commodities) and/or has a lot of debt (REITs, consumer staples, telecoms) may at certain point face to need to cut a dividend. A mutual fund will hopefully ease the pain.

Review
Ive kept my upkeep on it up to date. Bought with 98k miles 5 years ago. Now has over 265k and its still going strong. Comfortable, and appealing, its a dream to drive!

There are others that aren't nearly as good. With a new car, your chances of a lemon are probably less than .05%, with a used 18 year old car with 80k miles, it is probably more like 40%. But, you did your homework...it will either be the buy of the century, or you will be out a few dollars......Good luck!

These guys are getting ahead of the telecoms, unfortunately. Caller ID is no longer useful, unless it's your friend you are waiting for. The spoofing technology is just too good for the authorities. Yesterday a lady called me ""who is this"", ""who IS THIS"", ""You called me"", ""No I didn't"". Then I explained to her she was probably called by a scammer who spoofed my number.

It's really a bigger and bigger nuisance. Seems like those extended warranty calls are another breed of scammers, not just overly aggressive businesses. I wonder the angle - is it about immediate payment that goes to nowhere? The ""IRS People"" call me on my home, usually every three months. They usually leave a message with a robovoice. As you said, by the time you call back, the number is already disconnected, so those guys are really ineffective. You'd have to call them right away to be scammed.

There are others that aren't nearly as good. With a new car, your chances of a lemon are probably less than .05%, with a used 18 year old car with 80k miles, it is probably more like 40%. But, you did your homework...it will either be the buy of the century, or you will be out a few dollars......Good luck!

Everything else running perfectly at the moment. Tires and brake pads still good. So far after 3 1/2 years I have spent a total of $40. And it’s still under warranty for another several months.

Someone mentioned State Farm. I had them. After having to use them, they were the most arrogant, obstinate and unhelpful insurance company I’ve ever encountered. I dropped them like a hot potato. Don’t believe their ads. If they can try to misdirect, misinterpret, launch into legal jumbo jumbo to keep from paying a claim, they will.

It’s not just their local people who succumb to this. This stems from corporate on down.

@iluvmysephia1 ...no surprise the dealer is taking that Sentra to auction. I would like to see what it sells for with a “manufacturer buy back title”. Some dealer will take another chance on it. But, I’d be willing the selling price will be south of 5 figures. Still not sure that would be any sort of deal on that car.

Speaking of Buy Backs, as if on cue, I got a call from the guy who sold me my last CTS last night to tell me about all the programs Cadillac has going on right now. Understand, this guy not only sold me the car (to replace the other Cadillac with problems) and worked with me on all the paperwork that needed for a couple of weeks. He also was involved with me for the months my other Cadillac was in their shop and all the paperwork GM wanted before writing me the buy back check. In brief, we had spent quite a bit of time together.

Anyway, I asked him why he would even think of calling me to try to get me into the dealership for a new car. He feigned ignorance and claimed he didn’t know about the troubles I had with my CTS(s). I replayed all the troubles, transactions, the paperwork we had to go through, the weeks and months we communicated back and forth. He said he remembers none of it.

I left him with “I don’t think you’re senile. But, make it a point to erase my phone number, my email, my address from your list”. Anyone who doesn’t remember that entire fiasco, isn’t someone I’d likely do business with again.” I did tell him to have a good day, and wished him good luck. But, didn’t wait around for any reply before I hung up.

It does have a lot to do with where you live. When I lived out in the boonies, my car insurance was really cheap. Now, inside the loop, it is much more expensive. But that's actually understandable. I lived out in the boonies for 10 years, never had a single claim. 8 years in the city, 3 claims (twice I was ran over, and once had the hood stolen). People living in the city, especially the inner city, are going to have more claims. Therefore, you're going to pay more for car insurance.

USAA was the cheapest when I lived out in the boonies, by quite a margin. Now they're not, but they are within reasonable distance of the cheapest quotes. So I will just stay where I am, and keep enjoying their great service.

I have no idea why USAA doesn't like South Florida. I know that a lot of their members are retired military living in Florida, so I would think they would favor Florida.

They finally pull out and I turned off my flashers on put on my right directional signal to let the car behind me that I was making a right turn into that spot.  Before I knew it, this young man pulls around me and drives into the spot.  I missed hitting him by inches.

I got out of my car to confront him for “stealing” my parking space.  An employee who picks up shopping baskets in the lot saw the whole thing and as I begin to admonish him along with the Publix employee, he gives both of us the “bird” and told us to f..k ourselves and left to go into the store.

But, I got realistic about the possible consequences to that revenge strategy and got back in my car and found another spot in the next row of cars.

They really hate your gut there, Mike. My insurance never crossed equivalent of $1450/yr (typically my insurers sell 6 month coverages), but for years I've had more like 1100-1200, sometimes less. My coverages are typically highest offered liability, standard 500 deductible and reduced uninsured. My PIP portion is usually the smallest.

But there are some insurers that hate me, too. Liberty has never come with anything remotely competitive, Geico has always been higher. One or two other also came with some rates out of their rear ends. I've had best prices with Progressive, Travelers and Ameriprise, until the last one jacked up my premium by 50 percent on nothing other than me refinancing the house. I think they just simply wanted out, as later they pulled out from new policies altogether. There was a ramp up in fraud in Florida in both home and auto policies and some insurers drastically pulled their horns. It seems to have normalized since, at least here. One time I got Allstate, but they jacked up prices after a year by 20 percent, then another 20 on the very next renewal (just 6 months after the first jackup), so I thanked them.

I always wondered how different businesses can have so different risk models that come up with 50-100 percent spreads in rates for the same product for the same people.

Yep. Back when I drove my C20 on a regular basis, and cars were generally more durable, I dealt a few times with people who would steal a designated parking spot I had for a couple years. I got to where I would just park behind them with my bumper to theirs, go into my building and call the local police shop to ticket them. They would get a $75 fine, which was a lot back in the 90s (comparatively), then wait for them to return. When they would, I would go down, admonish them for their actions, move out of the way, let them go, and then park.

I had a lot more time on my hands back then.

Another time, I had this little car park so close to me that I couldn't get into my truck. I had to go around the passenger side and slide over. Once I was in, I backed out, pulled up behind them, and pushed the car over the bump stop. It was a low car, so it rested on the stop (e.g., likely high-centered). I got a great laugh about that one, but did not stick around to see what the reaction was.

Not getting into politics, it seems there is a lot of political risk in the world, right now. So, it's not what you think will probably happen, it's the level of chance that something negative will happen.

I think the Fed is doing a great job with interest rates. Some call it tightening, but as you mentioned, I think of it as normalizing rates. For exactly the reason you mention.

I play around with trading around the edges, but I still have a 35 year investment horizon. I have no interest in getting to a certain point, then putting everything in cash or bonds to mitigate risk. My first 35 years of investing tell me to stay invested through ups and downs.

I'm pretty aggressive, though. Easily 85%+ in equities.

I think the U.S. dollar getting stronger is not necessarily a good thing--it's complicated. This strengthening might put a big strain on some foreign economies, and the global economy is a lot more fragile than people might think--if things go south in one place, then the whole structure starts to react.

I'm holding tight in a very diversified portfolio and leaning more toward fixed income investments. I feel this ""strong economy"" is too debt-driven, not productivity-driven, and stocks are leveraged way out and over-valued.

We have Allstate in Florida....one of the few insurers who will write up a Canadian. Most don't want to be bothered trying to check past history, they don't get that Canadians want at least $1 million liability, and we don't conform in other ways....home ownership, etc.

The problem I find with Allstate is I have no idea what their invoices mean.....they give you a high rate, then subtract for all kinds of things, having ABS, having blind spot monitoring, no accidents, having air bags, for being a long term customer (sucker) etc....and with all the extra savings........my rates keep going up and I think they are higher than if I switched...if I could find someone.

I often wonder what AARP actually does for seniors in any meaningful way.
They also have great ads for very simple computers that seniors can use.....and cell phones with large buttons that have huge numbers....and you can only use them for actually calling people.

Excellent question. I don't believe it's anything much at all. If it weren't for the hotel discounts, I wouldn't bother with them.
For my $10 a year I get a nice insulated bag to carry drinks etc., and I save on hotels....and 15% at Denny's. The Canadian version, called CARP, does do some lobbying for seniors, and does try to pass legislation that is beneficial to seniors. The Canadian one has gotten some beneficial legislation passed.......and, I think it is a good idea to have someone looking out for our interests. To be fair, they do have some excellent articles in their newspaper too....about managing money and health issues.

That is one thing I find surprising with these companies: They really don't care about your loyalty at all. I have a separate policy on my Q7 than the rest of my fleet, because insuring that car through my primary Allstate policy, which I have had for 21 years, is just insanely expensive. Through State Farm, I pay almost exactly half the amount they wanted for it, and I have better coverage. The only benefit I really see to the Allstate policy is that I have had it so long that I qualify for ""unlimited accident forgiveness."" Basically, they have fleeced me so much over the years that they won't drop me or raise my rates due to claims (or so they say). Also, when asking about the prospect of adding my son to my policy, it was only about 15% higher than adding a car myself. In other words, shockingly reasonable!

2024,August 23,henryn,"From WikiPedia:

According to the group's official history, Dr. Ethel Percy Andrus founded AARP in 1958. AARP evolved from the National Retired Teachers Association (NRTA), which Andrus had established in 1947 to promote her philosophy of productive aging, and to promote health insurance for retired teachers. After ten years, she opened the organization to all Americans over 50, creating AARP.[8] Today, the NRTA is a division within AARP.[9]

Critics of AARP offer an alternative version of the group's origins. 60 Minutes reported in a 1978 exposé that AARP had been established as a marketing device by Leonard Davis, founder of the Colonial Penn Group insurance companies, after he met Ethel Percy Andrus.[10] According to critics, until the 1980s AARP was controlled by Davis, who promoted its image as a non-profit advocate of retirees in order to sell insurance to members.[11] Possibly as a result of this report, AARP conducted a competitive bidding process, and, in 1980, shifted the insurance contracts available to members to Prudential Financial.[12]

In the 1990s, the United States Senate investigated AARP's non-profit status, with Republican Senator Alan K. Simpson, then chairman of the United States Senate Finance Subcommittee on Social Security, Pensions, and Family Policy, questioning the organization's tax-exempt status in congressional hearings. According to Charles Blahous, the investigations did not reveal sufficient evidence to change the organization's status,[13] though in an interview years later by the Des Moines Register, Senator Simpson remained ""troubled by AARP's practices"", calling AARP ""the biggest marketing operation in America and money-maker"" and an organization whose practices are ""the greatest abuse of American generosity I witnessed in my time in the U.S. Senate"".[14]

Computer so much more intuitive too - you can simply reach out and touch what you want to do.

But, there’s no “cookie cutter” strategy that fits all the people all the time. Yes, there are certain things to adhere to (like the above), but I’ve been known to extend myself a bit for an asset that I thought would appreciate quite a bit (like some stocks and certainly when I bought my first house). Aside from minor hiccups, those investments have paid off handsomely.

That said, I’m trying to think of any time that I’ve even spent 50% of my yearly income on a car. I’m struggling to think of an instance where I got close.

When I was eating “rice and beans” because of my budget, I was buying used cars that had a reputation of reliability (pretty mundane Toyotas and Hondas that were miled up). That was a long while ago, though (thankfully).

As these things go, there are exceptions to every rule. If a car has a rebranded title, but it’s cheap, you probably don’t have much financial exposure with it if a catastrophe happens. Same goes for older cars. Those may not matter one way or the other if they have a rebuilt title or not.

It's not exactly an unfair system for that segment, definitely much more favorable here than in other (quasi) developed areas.

Definitely we are not overtaxed, some of us much less than others. Nobody said we are overtaxed. We pay little, and receive little in return, relative to peers in other locations. That's the Murkan way, bootstraps, temporarily embarrassed millionaires, medical bankruptcy, etc. It works well for some, while others are left behind.

Good luck reducing SS in this day and age, when due to wage stagnation, increasing living costs not factored into inflation numbers, and a Gatsbyesque socio-economic chasm, many simply can't afford to save for the future, and because pensions now don't exist save for citizens deluxe working for public agencies and a few remaining industries, SS is all some will have. Political suicide, nobody would run with it. Regarding anything medical, eventually there will be real pressure for some form of single payer system.

It's interesting to see the insane lack of self-awareness from some demographics out there, usually those kept afloat by family or public sector largesse, who think they built something themselves. Entitlements, both in numbers and mentalities, go both ways.

I'd like a lot of things, too. Good luck with that wish.

Oh yeah, the Tax Foundation also receives its fair share of questions and criticism. It isn't as non-partisan as it may claim.

We can relitigate things many times, if you wish. The facts are that 70 percent of revenue from income tax in 2015 was coming from those evil top 10 of earners, almost 38 percent of revenue from the most evil 1 percent. Their participation in total income is much smaller. Of course, to be fair, you'd need to add FICA taxes, which would shuffle the percentages a bit in favor of the lower brackets, but the facts remain.

So I would like you at least say ""thank you"" to those people who actually keep this country afloat, not vilify them. After that we can have rational discussion, whether or not it may be good for them to chip in more to shore up our nation's ailing balance sheet, not just demand they pay more because they're evil and owe the rest of us everything they've got. No can do? That's where the problem lies. Ideology trumps the facts, for both sides.

I don't think we are particularly overtaxed. Anybody who lived a day abroad knows we are not. But I do think we are spending too much, not just on military. We have grossly overpromised to future seniors (including myself in the future), particularly in Medicare, also a bit in Social Security. It's really startling when you hear that it will me middle of next decade already when the funds go insolvent (i.e. payments exceed receivables and zero savings on the account), yet everybody is acting like it's not there. Ignoring it only going to make the hammer fall harder. I already assume that if I get 75% of my currently calculated SS (adjusted for inflation), I'll be a lucky man. If you ever looked at your own Medicare statement and see how much you paid into the system (I did), including your employer's contribution and compare it with costs of care and rate of consumption amongst people over 65, the numbers miss each other not by 10 or 20 percent, they miss each other by factor of three or four, even if you adjust for people who will never consume it (died prior eligibility). It's a joke, but not very funny. It can't be fixed by raising the tax, there is no amount that can shore that up without killing the economy. The only way to fix it is to do both - raise the rates a little and rework the entitlement promise (yes, reduce it). But anobody, who raises the issue in its earnest, tries to propose any rational changes, is vilified as pushing grandma from the cliff."

I like listening to ZZ Top's 'Fandango' album in my car as I drive to go see ZZ Top. I like driving safely - I like preserving life. I love cars. I love the looks of the cars I buy. Sure, the Ford Focus ST is a fine looking car and I may decide on one eventually. I'm just not a racer - I'd rather stop and read the historical road signs alongside the road. This country's chock full of history and I hate missing out on some good history along the way. Having said that about not needing to race, I do remember driving my Lancer GTS in Tucson with it's heavy cross-town traffic. The Lancer GTS had a 152-hp 148-ft.lb. of torque 4-cyl. engine with an automatic CVT transmission with paddle shifters. I would as a practice rev up that engine and get myself out of some of the nastiest traffic jams and pull out in front - way out in front with a jubilance of Shawn Kemp when dunking the ball off of Michael Jordan's head in the '96 NBA Finals. VAROOOMMM!!! That Mitsubishi motor could be wrung out with a fairly quick succinction of power on the spot to get away from nasty pools of traffic. That and U-Turns: Tucson is the city of U-turns. My point about this is that I sometimes enjoy a little road racing - a burst of power to get in and out of the holes on the road like a hard-running NFL halfback. It's run. This Sentra SR Turbo 6-speed would give me that power for quick city-burst getaways. I'd spin them with glee. I'm not totally immune to the appeal of driving a car hard and I'm somewhat interested in track driving - just not enough to pursue it with immediate abandon. That's all. It could be learned and I could see it being sort of a obsessive compulsive disorder buzz of some kind - the kind that the Ford Focus ST would deliver in an instant. Ford engineers have done a marvelous job with the Focus ST - I'm really proud of them. It's a shame they're poop-canning car production for the U.S. I hope they change their minds on that decision.

The 2017-18 Nissan Sentra SR Turbo is 188hp coming in at 5600rpm and 177 ft.lb. of torque that comes in at a low 1600rpm (that stays flat all the way up to 5200rpm) contained in this engine Nissan took out of their Juke: a 1.6L 4-cyl direct-injected gasoline turbocharged engine. That is coupled with an intercooler and a compression ratio of 10.5:1, all linked with a 6-speed transmission. In this YouTube video Motoman drives a silver 2017 Nissan Sentra SR Turbo 6-speed and shares what he learns. In a nutshell, he describes it as ""enough power:sure - but would you want more power? Ahh...yes.""


Motoman's YouTube video on the 2017 Nissan Sentra SR Turbo 6-speed: Part II of III

As I was describing earlier, I don't live to race. Simply put it boils down to what the car has - which, to me, is a lot of cool body design and a smart interior layout with loads of room in the backseat for guest riders as well as the Mrs. and I in the front. Plus, what I think is a killer body design. This is my Datsun 510 sedan in 2018 form. The 510 is the subcompact that Nissan took and made the Sentra design off of - I knew there was something cool about the Sentra that was lingering around, thick and deep with history - well, that's it - it's continuously harkening my mind back to the late 60's with 411 Bluebird and 510 imagery fleshed out in 2017-2018 as the Sentra. It's subtle yet firm as a swift take down from someone like Dennis Rodman under the Detroit Piston frontcourt. Right up and in my face, car nuts!


Reliability has been good for the Sentra - the 2017-18's no exception. The SR Turbo 6-speed I save for will be like the one I detailed last night with the lighting kit for automatic fade-in and fade-out lighting upon entry, special SR Turbo stitching on the doors and floormats, on-board tech package and rear-view camera, sunroof, heated front seats, foglights up front and a small spoiler out back that gives a subtle splay off the taillights and separation up above the Nissan Sentra trim in back. I think it's slightness works well back there and adds to the design instead of some of the ridiculous spoilers of the past. My 2008 Mitsubishi Lancer GTS had a larger spoiler, but Mitsu pulled it off by designing the taillights to pry down and up to the right at the rear corners. Design like that isn't stumbled upon - it's earned by doing it right. Just right.















So, in conclusion of this little pamphlet I've made, roadburner - I can understand where you're coming from on the immediate speed-mobile thing - the Ford Focus ST would be a natural there. If you have time, though, watch Motoman's Part II of III video I have plopped up above on the 2017 Nissan Sentra SR Turbo 6-spd stick. Watch him take the car off the line and in to and out of mountain turns.

I really think I would love this car. Fades out to Deep Purple's megahit 'Highway Star.'

Not to mention delusional trickle down tax policy that has no basis in reality, but due to TEM syndrome, is tried and tried again.

Oops, hope that isn't ""class warfare"".

The attitude of each generation to the next is ""I got mine, to heck with you"" - as long as that can is kicked down the road, nothing will change.
We can relitigate things many times, if you wish. The facts are that 70 percent of revenue from income tax in 2015 was coming from those evil top 10 of earners, almost 38 percent of revenue from the most evil 1 percent. Their participation in total income is much smaller. Of course, to be fair, you'd need to add FICA taxes, which would shuffle the percentages a bit in favor of the lower brackets, but the facts remain.

So I would like you at least say ""thank you"" to those people who actually keep this country afloat, not vilify them. After that we can have rational discussion, whether or not it may be good for them to chip in more to shore up our nation's ailing balance sheet, not just demand they pay more because they're evil and owe the rest of us everything they've got. No can do? That's where the problem lies. Ideology trumps the facts, for both sides.

I don't think we are particularly overtaxed. Anybody who lived a day abroad knows we are not. But I do think we are spending too much, not just on military. We have grossly overpromised to future seniors (including myself in the future), particularly in Medicare, also a bit in Social Security. It's really startling when you hear that it will me middle of next decade already when the funds go insolvent (i.e. payments exceed receivables and zero savings on the account), yet everybody is acting like it's not there. Ignoring it only going to make the hammer fall harder. I already assume that if I get 75% of my currently calculated SS (adjusted for inflation), I'll be a lucky man. If you ever looked at your own Medicare statement and see how much you paid into the system (I did), including your employer's contribution and compare it with costs of care and rate of consumption amongst people over 65, the numbers miss each other not by 10 or 20 percent, they miss each other by factor of three or four, even if you adjust for people who will never consume it (died prior eligibility). It's a joke, but not very funny. It can't be fixed by raising the tax, there is no amount that can shore that up without killing the economy. The only way to fix it is to do both - raise the rates a little and rework the entitlement promise (yes, reduce it). But anobody, who raises the issue in its earnest, tries to propose any rational changes, is vilified as pushing grandma from the cliff.

How did she finally get out of it? And how big a loss?
Stick....my sister never did tell me the numbers, as I warned her against buying anything without a clean title. Apparently she mentioned something to our late Mother, bemoaning she lost “5 figures” on the car.

She shopped it around to BMW dealers and got no takers (not even an offer). She advertised it as a private owner car, and didn’t get any sniffs either (this was when CarFax was just strarting out and people could look up a car’s history).

She ended up selling it to another small used lot just to get some cash out of it.

Not wanting to relive that experience with the Caddy, for certain.

@iluvmysephia1 ....funny about the descriptions of “rebuilt titles” or “manufacturer buybacks”. They always act like they bought the cars back was for a minor issue to make the customer happy. Nothing could be further from the truth. Manufacturers loath to buy back a vehicle and will fight tooth and nail to keep from doing so. They’ll also throw their (considerable) legal and corporate weight around trying to wear down a customer so they just give up pursuing a buyback.

I’m absolutely certain the buyback on that Sentra was more than just replacing an O2 sensor. There’s more to it....a lot more to it, I’m certain. Don’t succumb to the dealership feigning they don’t know what they have. They know exactly what they have. Sounds like they were trying to add to the pot by knowing and incorrectly stating it was a NIMSO, when it really wasn’t.

My younger sister fell for one of those “rebuilt title” cars a few years ago. She found a 1 year old 3 series with a rebuilt title that seemed like a steal. It wasn’t being sold by a dealership, but by a local used car lot (which I wasn’t familiar with). They told her the car had a rebuilt title because the original owner left his window open during a rain storm because the window regulator broke.

She said there was no evidence of a wreck (which was true), and that the used car lot only had to replace the window regulator to give the car a clean bill of health. Fast forward 4 months later when the electrics were giving her all sorts of fits. She finally took it to my BMW dealership who found dampness and water under the carpets, behind the door cards, under the trunk mat, etc. They said it looked like it had been in a flood.

Digging around a bit, found out it originally came from the east coast and was one of the cars that was affected by the super storm Sandy. Tracing it back, the car was totaled by the insurance company, then bought by an aggregator who specialized in such cars, and then sold at auction to the used car dealer my sister bought it from.

She kept it a year. It never ran right. She babied it along to keep it on the road (usually with wipers, ECU, lights, etc either not functioning, or functioning sporadically. I can’t recall the amount of times she was left stranded.

But, it looked good and she got a “hulluva” deal on it.
I have (twice) bought cars - well, one car, one truck - with a rebuilt title.

The car was an older Cadillac, which had been side swiped, damage to the right rear door and the right rear fender. It was purchased (from the insurance company, at auction) by a guy who did body work on the side. The guy who fixed it up and sold it to me had pictures of the before and after, so that I could plainly see that it was only superficial body damage (not frame). I saved a lot of money, and my only two worries were that the bondo or the paint might come loose, and that my insurance company did not want to do collision and comprehensive. I paid so little for the car that I was willing to go with just liability insurance, and if the paint peeled off I could live with that. I drove that car for a couple of years, never had any problems with the body work, and sold it for more than I paid for it.

The truck was stolen and stripped, not wrecked, not flooded, and the owner showed me proof of that. The original owner bought it back from the insurance company, who totaled it. He found a similar wrecked truck, bought the whole thing, transferred the seats, the tires and wheels, the stereo, the tailgate, a few other things. He kept it for several more years before he sold it to me. I got a very nice truck for a greatly reduced price. When I explained all of this to my insurance company, they had no problem selling me full coverage.

The only slightly weird thing, the seats were not a good color match for the interior door panels and other trim. Which didn't bother me, but I did get a few questions about that!

Back in the mid-late '90s I was Project Manager for the Province on a Personal Property Registry system - essentially a system where all liens would be recorded against anything that was used as collateral for borrowing, except for mortgages against real estate. Prior to that a lien against a car or a yacht would need to be recorded on paper in each of 17 registry offices around the province, which of course never happened and so it was pretty useless.

One of the things that I learned from that is as you say, some places in other parts of the world had no mechanism at all for such borrowing and so it was pretty limited and really hurt their economies. I went to a few conferences where people from places in South America, Africa and Asia were in attendance to try to figure out how to set something similar up for their countries. In fact the young lady I hired to be the provincial registrar here eventually went to work for the World Bank to help them do exactly that. She did very well for herself, at the cost of spending almost all her time in the Far East.

The problem is that our economy exists on debt. If people stopped buying on credit, and only spent as much, or less, than they earned, our entire monetary system would utterly collapse. We are a debt-driven economy, not a productivity-driven economy. I mean, the government spends way more than it earns, so why would citizens be encouraged to ""austerity""?

For certain, the automobile biz would suffer horribly.

The average monthly loan payment for a new vehicle hit an all-time high of $523 in the first quarter, according to Experian.

The average amount borrowed by buyers of new cars, trucks and SUVs also climbed to a record high of $31,453.
Both monthly loan payments on my Infiniti ($612.27) & my wife's Pilot ($538.17 after I put $10,500 down) exceed the ""all time high."" I wholeheartedly agree with you that as a society, we are addicted to debt. The nation's economy should depend on debt as much as it does. Watch what would happen if interest rates were suddenly raised 2 points. Auto sales? Home sales? Mortgages? That's just the tip of the iceberg.

I assume things were similar in the US, but I remember up here in late 1980 and 1981 having interest rates on low-risk consumer debt at 18% and up. The company where I worked had set up a loan to buy a new IBM computer system and between the time that was done and the time the thing finally got delivered the rate jumped to over 20%. People were getting mortgages renewed at those rates too with a huge jump in their monthly payment. It was nuts.

Quicken is one of the pieces of software I tend to give rave reviews to. Been using it since 1995, and I don't know if we'd have made it through things without it. My most eye-opening Quicken moment came when I entered about 6 months of bank statement data to get started and had to categorize things. Well, debit cards hadn't hit yet, and we would still go to the ATM and grab a $20 if we needed cash. So you'd get that $20 to buy the widget that was $11, and the other $9 would just disappear into the ether.

I was shocked that ATM withdrawals were 27% of our spending. Just being aware of that cut it down to about 12% immediately. Debit cards came around and got me below 3% shortly thereafter.

I really don't set up a budget using Quicken, although I DO look at how much we spend on what... which is kinda the same thing.

I think it's fine to make money providing people what they need. I understand that Ramsay made most of his money before he became a radio host and his story was that as a young man he got rich ""quickly"" through real estate, then he lost it all due to over-leveraging, then he made it back the ""right way"", which of course took him more time.

That's the thing with debt - it extends your gains in good times and magnifies losses in bad times. People (companies, too) go into debt in good times assuming that bad times will never come. I always say that when something bad happens to you, I believe if you tell me it was not your fault. But if you were financially unprepared to face that difficulty after years of holding a well paying job, years during which all you dealt with was regular life without extraordinary financially draining hardships (e.g. child with a disability, sick relative, or similar) , IT IS YOUR FAULT.

2148,August 21,iluvmysephia1,"Exactly! The dealers around here advertise new STs for a minimum of $3500 off of MSRP.
I'd estimate that an ST is at worst 1,000,000% more fun to drive than the Sentra SR.

A Nissan Sentra SR Turbo 6-speed can go 0-60 in around 7.5 seconds. Depends on one's shifting skill. A 2018 Ford Focus ST 6-speed can go 0-60 in around 6.3 seconds. A 2011 Kia Soul 5-speed can go 0-60 in around 10 seconds. When I'm car shopping I'm not Mario Andretti-ing it up.

I want legroom in the back like the Sentra SR Turbo 6-speed has, industry leading in it's class. I want a certain body style look, it is a look that Nissan has designed-in to the Sentra SR Turbo 6-speed just right for me. I don't freak out about having a finely-tailored interior - colors of black and grey and plastics molded to look like metals work just fine for me. Piano black sprays and splays are cool but not required.

I also don't need industry-leading schnick-shifters. I need shifters that go to the spot they're supposed ta go and stay there. By all rights, the Ford Focus ST would work out better for me as my No.2 car. My play car.

The choice for me is the Nissan Sentra SR Turbo 6-speed. My hunting subjects have been nailed down to just one car. Made by one carmaker. It's the whole offering that needs to line up, with the Mrs. and I the cost of the car comes in to consideration, yes, as does ghastly mileage per gallon of ghastly. Like I said in my midnight post last night, most people wouldn't gasp or shreek with delight while driving a Nissan Sentra SR Turbo. I would absolutely love it and I wouldn't count out a YEEE-HAAAWWW coming from iluvmysephia1.

Everybody is a genius in a bull market, aren't they? I still relish some of Jim Cramer's incredibly wrong stock calls, as well as his god-awful advice in 2008.
So you remember it wrong. He was calling for everybody to get out for months. I have watched his show for years. He was the one of the first people on TV (not counting permabears, who were telling you to get out all the way from 2001) to tell the storm was coming. His infamous ""they know nothing"" meltdown was in September or August 2007, well before most people were aware there was something very wrong with the system. He did not change his tune until March 2009, which was the bottom.

In your ""bad advice"", you may be referring to the most misunderstood piece of talk television, i.e. a caller asking about Bear Stearns. People quote this as hims saying it was safe, as stock of Stearns day before the collapse (JP Morgan taking it ""under""). Would be pretty damning, if it only were true. The caller actually asked about his account in Stearns (I heard it live and I knew what he asked), not the stock. He said it was safe and IT WAS, as JP Morgan simply took it over. Best of all, the caller was asked couple of weeks later, after the the takeover went into effect, whether his money in was OK. But who cares about the truth. Cramer had some bad stock calls over the years, but he did a lot to warn people about banks all the way from 2007 to 2009.

Warranty or not, you'd have to be categorically insane to buy a car that's been branded as a ""manufacturer's buyback."" Cars do get bought back for various reasons ranging from physical defects to major mechanical malfunctions. The point is, that it isn't easy. Sometimes you have to get a lawyer involved. Someone has got to be EXTREMELY unhappy in the 1st place to get this going.

I'm glad Dave Ramsey is independently wealthy and doesn't need to finance cars like the rest of us do. Maybe he can start buying cars for people who call into his show so he doesn't have to have a fit.

If you are serious about a Focus ST, why not start a search for a NEW one? You seem to maintain your cars properly & the car isn't THAT expensive to begin with. I'm sure there will be some healthy discounts and cheapo financing. Leftover, orphaned cars can be great if you find one you like. I bought my 2001 Prelude Type SH in April of 2002 as a leftover.

His advice especially to those who've ended up in financial troubles is sage on how to go about getting themselves into a solid paying off, and saving, pattern. He has them eliminating the most expensive debt first and saving into rainy day funds. He advises them to get extra income with a part time job for one or both people if married.

The people who call in to report their success after a year or more sound like they've benefitted from his advice. And some people come to the studios to report their successful establishment of no debt and good budgeting.

That's all much better than those folks getting hooked on the scam articles who advertise they get rid of debt to the IRS or get other negatives off your financial records.

Cold turkey, sure, it would be pretty bad short term and might persists for some time. However, over time the economy would rebalance itself. Rare and expensive goods would still remain rare and expensive, with one difference - people who don't have money would not have illusions they can have them today.
BTW, as I said before, I'm not against debt, but I know financial leverage is very dangerous and can be destructive. For people and for businesses. Same great metrics of ""financial efficiency"" turn into death spiral on just small changes in the cashflow. The problem is people tend to be overly optimistic about their own ability to pay, earn money, they underestimate threats, overestimate windfalls. Same with companies and investors. This all adds up to system of financial crises popping up like a clockwork, every 20 years, with ""end of civilization"" financial experience once every couple of generations. Seems like people already forgot about those houses on bought negative amortization loans. And I can tell you - I saw first hand how little some people understood from 2008/9 crisis. All they took from it was ""evil banks screwed good people"", so they didn't have to change a thing in their own life, unless forced by those evil banks.

2196,August 21,iluvmysephia1,"Man, I have watched a ton of videos on YouTube reviewing the Ford Focus ST.

""The Focus RS has 100 more horsepower and a drive system that is called a GKN all-wheel drive system. It has a Twinster twin-clutch system. In Ford's drift mode, the AWD system delivers even more torque to the rear axle, delivering enough torque to the rear wheels for the RS to achieve a controlled ""drift"" through corners."" The RS retails for around $41,000.

But the more inexpensive Ford Focus ST retails for something more like $25,000 and gets excellent reviews on YouTube, too. I really like the Ford Focus ST.



2018 is the last year Ford will offer the Focus ST in America.

I have also been looking at my other current favorite, the Nissan Sentra. My latest idea is to get a slightly used Nissan Sentra SR Turbo 6-speed. Here's one - a manufacturer buyback - at Bill Luke Chrysler in Tempe.








I've decided that I like the grey on the Sentra SR Turbo. It's got 7,686 miles on it. It's engine has 188hp, it is a 6-speed stick, sunroof, metal accents on the interior, rear view camera and it has the foglights up front. I pulled in to a Del Taco following one of these cars in black and it had my eye following it in. Looked nice. They incorrectly added NISMO on to the end of Turbo in one of their written descriptions of the car. It's not a NISMO - once again the dealer doesn't know what kind of car they're selling. It's price is $12,000 and this one even has heated front seats. I looked at the CarFax and wanted to see what the buyback was for. The owner had to take it in to get an oxygen sensor replaced and then apparently was annoyed about a check engine light. I have read up on manufacturer buybacks and apparently it doesn't always mean the rig is ""cursed"". Sometimes the car gets blamed for a dealer's service center waiting longer than usual for a part to come in, sometimes the service center doesn't fix a problem properly, etc. It's not just the car breaking down repeatedly leading to the ""lemon"" designation. The fix has been made already - more than just a few potential buyers would gawk and balk at the buyback designation and leave this one alone. It's heading to auction soon, the dealer says. These cars retail for $22,600. If I were to head to Tempe, AZ, from here to go test drive this car and I liked it, I would offer $11,000 tops and ask for a 6-year, 60,000 mile powertrain Warranty on this pup. If they would oblige me there, I'd trade in the Soul and get it. The Mrs. wants us to wait till my next birthday when I turn 60 and begin collecting my Boeing pension monthly payments, save for 12 months, then buy our next car in cash completely. Dave Ramsay philosophy - he absolutely has a conniption fit if someone buys a car over time. We took the 2011 Kia Soul in today and I wanted an oil change, plugs, plug wires, possibly a fuel filter and possibly an air filter. Martin Tire had me out the door with only an oil change. These guys are great - I love an honest tire and repair shop. I took my '08 Lancer GTS there and then this car after the '08 Lancer GTS' engine blew to smithereens. The Soul has 103,345 miles on it and yes, it's running well. It broke down a month or so ago and needed a crankcase sensor sending unit replaced to the tune of $360.61. All's well now - I'm ready to trade and take on a 60-month note. She's not. I know modern cars will go 150,000 miles now and really could go and should go 175,000 miles. The Kia Soul also broke down a year ago in Wenatchee - it turned out ta be a bad ignition switch and Wenatchee Kia had us fixed for only about $265 that time IIRC. Our Enterprise rental van - a 2017 Dodge Caravan GT, costed more by about a hundred dollars than the ignition switch repair came to! Truth be told - I'm getting more serious about trading in, y'all.

Whenever I really get serious about buying my next rig it'll be one of these babies. The 2013 Ford Focus ST with 61,000 miles on it selling for only $11,500 is gone from it's spot downtown here in Alamogordo. As it turns out, $11,500 is beyond a fair selling price for the hot-hatch. I think I would love driving the Focus ST - YouTube reviewers sometimes yelp in excitement as they drive the car - two or three of them have!

Would anyone yelp in excitement driving a 2017 Nissan Sentra SR Turbo 6-speed? Ahh...I might.

I'll NEVER answer those, but do a quick Google search on the calling number, find out that it's a spammer and block it for all eternity

@iluvmysephia1 ....funny about the descriptions of “rebuilt titles” or “manufacturer buybacks”. They always act like they bought the cars back was for a minor issue to make the customer happy. Nothing could be further from the truth. Manufacturers loath to buy back a vehicle and will fight tooth and nail to keep from doing so. They’ll also throw their (considerable) legal and corporate weight around trying to wear down a customer so they just give up pursuing a buyback.

I’m absolutely certain the buyback on that Sentra was more than just replacing an O2 sensor. There’s more to it....a lot more to it, I’m certain. Don’t succumb to the dealership feigning they don’t know what they have. They know exactly what they have. Sounds like they were trying to add to the pot by knowing and incorrectly stating it was a NIMSO, when it really wasn’t.

My younger sister fell for one of those “rebuilt title” cars a few years ago. She found a 1 year old 3 series with a rebuilt title that seemed like a steal. It wasn’t being sold by a dealership, but by a local used car lot (which I wasn’t familiar with). They told her the car had a rebuilt title because the original owner left his window open during a rain storm because the window regulator broke.

She said there was no evidence of a wreck (which was true), and that the used car lot only had to replace the window regulator to give the car a clean bill of health. Fast forward 4 months later when the electrics were giving her all sorts of fits. She finally took it to my BMW dealership who found dampness and water under the carpets, behind the door cards, under the trunk mat, etc. They said it looked like it had been in a flood.

Digging around a bit, found out it originally came from the east coast and was one of the cars that was affected by the super storm Sandy. Tracing it back, the car was totaled by the insurance company, then bought by an aggregator who specialized in such cars, and then sold at auction to the used car dealer my sister bought it from.

She kept it a year. It never ran right. She babied it along to keep it on the road (usually with wipers, ECU, lights, etc either not functioning, or functioning sporadically. I can’t recall the amount of times she was left stranded.

But, it looked good and she got a “hulluva” deal on it.

I'll say if I had to get a Sentra, I'd want the fanciest one possible, to detach from the fleet-grade style of normal models. And for something like an ST, which may attract those who drive too hard, new is a safer bet, just like with a WRX or similar.

I think you're probably wrong about Ramsey. I heard him on several times on occasion and all he said then was exactly don't spend more than you make. Perhaps things changed since then. He spoke a lot against debt, which included buying cars on credit. I can say that - most of us here are sophisticated and sober enough to understand our own credit capacity and has enough will power to keep the debt well under it. However, there are plenty of people out there who don't have such internal brakes and will borrow every dollar that is offered to them by anybody.

He's just preaching things people who should already know (and gaining wealth from those people), often to people who think they know it all already.

I don't think they'll succeed. Their stuff is expensive and the quality of the mechanicals may not be in par with expectations. American consumer is very unforgiving when it comes to post-sale service. They don't mind gaps and cheap plastics (if the price is low enough), but they want long warranties and ""open source"" maintenance - exact opposite from what's in Europe (great fit and finish and highway robbery during service, short warranties, too). I just don't see French executives getting American consumer, unless they steal some people from Nissan (Renault group) to run the expansion.

This is 335 or 340, depending on the year. Look at the rear quarter panel. 4-series has a different shape of the rear window, which is behind the door, as opposed to 3-series being part of the door. Also, notice the front quarterpanel ""gill"" in the 4-series GC, missing in your picture.

4-series is what used to be coupe/convertible 3-series. 4-series Grand Coupe starts as coupe and then builds up the rear. for the second set of doors and rear hatch. It also has frameless doors, just like the coupe does (you can see it in the center pillar). Sizewise 3 and 4 series they are nearly the same. I think 4-series has slightly wider wheeltrack. BTW, I love this color.

I just have a call blocker (free) on my cell phone set to allow calls from my contacts and NOT from my area code and prefix for the cell phone.

This is 335 or 340, depending on the year. Look at the rear quarter panel. 4-series has a different shape of the rear window, which is behind the door, as opposed to 3-series being part of the door. Also, notice the front quarterpanel ""gill"" in the 4-series GC, missing in your picture.

4-series is what used to be coupe/convertible 3-series. 4-series Grand Coupe starts as coupe and then builds up the rear. for the second set of doors and rear hatch. It also has frameless doors, just like the coupe does (you can see it in the center pillar). Sizewise 3 and 4 series they are nearly the same. I think 4-series has slightly wider wheeltrack. BTW, I love this color.

The idiots at my local VW dealer lost a sure sale back in 2007; at that time you could still order a GTI with quite a few separate options. I wanted one with the audio upgrade and no hole in the roof. First they tried to sell me a car with a sunroof at a larger discount. Hello? I don't want a sunroof! I asked about ordering one and they made it sound like the process was incredibly difficult(even though salespeople on VW Vortex advised that it was not a problem at all). I decided that if those nitwits wouldn't sell me the car I wanted I'd go elsewhere- and I bought a Mazdaspeed 3 not long after that.
I would imagine that now an ordered VW Passat would not be difficult to procure since the are built in Tennessee. Same thing for many other cars and SUV's that are built in the U.S.A.

Ordering a car for a customer is not what a salesman or sales manager prefers. Firstly, it delays the sale of an automobile - they can't count it as a sale until you leave the dealership with the car. An ordered car usually takes between 5 and 8 weeks to get to the dealership from the assembly point.

As for Lexus and Infiniti, it can take 8-12 weeks to get the car to the dealership from the time it is ordered from the factory. When I was at Infiniti as a manager, it was not difficult to procure a vehicle for a customer that did not want what we had on the lot. We carried an inventory of over 500 new cars. I had the ability to look up on my computer specific cars filtered for color, equipment, availability (in production, on the ocean, awaiting transport, at the port, or at another dealership. Thus, I could dealer-trade for the car the customer wanted, search the ports of entry, search what was in production or scheduled for production, on the ocean, etc. I never ordered a car for a customer - it took much too long to get the precise car or SUV the customer wanted. But all of the time, a customer would settle for one more option, especially if I picked up the cost of that option and threw it into the deal to sweeten it.

I've ordered only one car from Mercedes Benz - the one that came in sans some equipment - then had to have it re-ordered. I would not order a car from the factory again - what I usually desire is either in inventory or available at another dealer.

I think some of those differences are just ""local flavors"" of the owners or management. However, it's clear that Japanese guys either don't even infrastructure built for car ordering at all (I know Honda simply doesn't take orders, period - not sure if that extends to Acura), or have it greatly reduced (I remember local Toyota dealer made it sound once as possible, just time consuming).

VW dealers are probably most inconsistent throughout all the brands, not just about orders - about anything. From old school greasy slick guys (take a long hot shower after a visit) to modern upscale dealers, pleasant and professional. I think it's because they are almost never stand alone, so their culture is usually driven by those other franchises they are attached to, as those are usually volume drivers. At least that's how it looks in Tampa Bay.

I think I mentioned this before that the car is quite nicely designed - with one exception - the front grille work. From the side and the rear, the car is beautiful. But then, when you look at that front end, it destroys the beauty of the car. Would I own a Camry - very possibly. I would want the 6 cylinder version and the leather interior - and all of the safety features I currently have become accustomed to. I have not driven the newly styled Camry and will probably do so prior to my lease ending. I've got plenty of time before that happens - but the styling on the new Camry and the new Avalon is a major departure for Toyota - the mundanely styled Toyotas seem to be a thing of the past - good move for Toyota.

As you know, I have ordered my last two cars. These were Euro delivery orders, but it was just a sweetener, I would most likely have ended up ordering them even without Euro delivery. The reason was my first car was 1. wagon 2. RWD, 3. Manual, 4. Fairly loaded, but not overloaded. Those simply did not exist on any dealer's lot in the US, even if I had relented on the color (I took blue, really didn't want grey, silver, white, or black, but might have taken white or black if really had no choice). So Euro or not, I would not have been able to get anywhere even close to what I wanted. My second 430i GC would have been a little easier, but still - there were several red available throughout the state, but all had beige or white interior. I would have taken saddle brown/cognac (depending on the model year), or black. I was also open to one or two other colors, but those also ran in beige and pearl white. Then there were options - dealers would have either ordered them stripped, or ""silly loaded"", nothing in between. I like to have certain ""minimum"", which is quite rich, but resist those thousands of bucks added for sake of options. BMW's configurations for 2015-17 models didn't help, either. It was only 2018, when they became much more rational in their configuration approach (I learned later that just six months into the model BMW changed it again and made it even better, but too late for me).

It was really frustrating sifting through the inventory at that time, as I felt I was a hostage to the local order manager's taste and gut feel. To anybody's assertion ""they ordered what sold"" I say that you could see huge differences between inventory of the same models at dealerships in the same metro area. One would have almost exclusively run-the-mill lease specials (non-offending colored strippers), another would be exact opposite - everything loaded to the gills and perhaps just a few strippers. This tells me ""what sells"" was mostly in managers' heads and had not that much to do actual market research. It might be based on some previous transaction records, but that can be very self-fulfilling. As much as I understood the previous situation with the wagon, I simply couldn't grasp why everybody thought that if it's red outside, it must be beige inside, or if it has M-Sport package, it must also have bunch of pricey appearance options raising its price by another 3 grand at least, or if it's 435/440, it must have every option checked under the Sun, running up the price by 15-20 grand to mid 60s, like it would have been a terrible insult to the brand to have a 435/440 priced at say 55-58 grand (still not a stripper then, just selective) sitting on the lot, which was something I would have been open to consider at the time.

Isn't ES based on Avalon now? I thought it's quite a bit bigger than Camry. Which is probably better for Mike. He could also get a good lease on it, as those keep value well.

There is a difference. Avalon is a made from modified Camry platform (stretched). In early years, ES used to be a rebadged and reworked Camry (almost ""the same car"", just better made overall, e.g. more welds). Over time, the differences became bigger and bigger.

It was really frustrating sifting through the inventory at that time, as I felt I was a hostage to the local order manager's taste and gut feel. To anybody's assertion ""they ordered what sold"" I say that you could see huge differences between inventory of the same models at dealerships in the same metro area. One would have almost exclusively run-the-mill lease specials (non-offending colored strippers), another would be exact opposite - everything loaded to the gills and perhaps just a few strippers. This tells me ""what sells"" was mostly in managers' heads and had not that much to do actual market research. It might be based on some previous transaction records, but that can be very self-fulfilling.
We have that here with our local domestic-model dealers. You cannot find a car in their inventory without a black interior unless it is a model that does not offer black (there used to be a couple of those, not sure now). They use the ""that's what sells"" argument and I think it is BS. I think about half the Mustangs the Ford dealers have in stock are black over black. Really unfortunate.

I saw what is surely a local unicorn today in a parking lot, a black Cruze that did not have a black interior, but instead had beige inside. Must have been a special order.

Another solution - don't buy as often. If you wait four years, not three they will look different. Usual refresh cycle is about 3-4 years for the face and double for the platform.
I think BMW takes longer...at least on some models. There are subtle differences on a 2018 535 compared to my 2012, but to most people it looks the same....even the inside seems pretty much the same.

When I got my 2000 Jeep Cherokee the salesman said a guy buys a new one every 2 years.....even though they never change. There is a bit of charm to that, especially with the Cherokee which ran like an old nostalgic car anyway......but, when you get a luxury car you expect there to be some major changes.

They no longer use the ""gutless 5 cyl"" engine. You have a choice of turbo 4 or normally aspirated V6.

The turbo 4 is adequate, but not nearly as good as the 2.0T engine you used to get in the Passat, and still get in the Audi. I would go for the V6.

I owned a 2008 Passat with the good 2.0T engine (my wife's car mostly). We went to 105k on that car with no major problems, and it was QUICK. Last year, I purchased a 2017 Passat R-Line, and only kept it about 6 months. Basically, I wanted back in a truck, and the 1.8T engine (upgraded this year to 2.0) is adequate, but not any fun. I haven't driven a Passat with the V6, but I expect I would enjoy it.

But ... the Passat is just not in the same class as the cars you are used to, high end BMW's and Mercedes. You would notice the difference, and be unhappy. If you're wanting to save money, and not be (too) unhappy with the step-down, I would think about a 2 year old CPO Genesis, Probably cost you less than $30k, very nice, luxurious, very quick. I don't think you would be disappointed, or feel like you had been significantly downgraded.

Hope your grandson gets along with his roommate.

I was thinking back through the roommates I had in my 4 years in ""coed"" dorm at Ball State University. Most memorable was a guy who smoked a cigar in the room. That didn't last long. Coed was men's dorm and women's dorm sharing cafeteria and double louge tv areas with heavy metal gates and a sniper's next to prevent crossovers during closed hours.First one on BSU campus.

In 2010, my son had a roommate who was not as studious as he. They shared a study area with desks and refrigerator. And a separate sleeping area with two bunk beds where each occupied a lower bunk, separated by a heavy wooden door from study area for quiet. Their study area also had a heavy wood door from the lounge TV area shared with the 6 other roommates and a multiple facility bathroom. A really private and yet apartment like setup. This was in one of the 2 round towers you might see in background next to the football stadium in TV shots.

Son's roomie spent a lot of time at the frat which was rushing him. Didn't do them much good--his dad, a tax lawyer moved him back home to Oklahoma at the end of his freshman year, figuring engineering was a lot cheaper at home and grades had to improve.

You are correct about roommates.  The college matches roomies with each other using a 4-page biographic/personality assessment that all live-on-campus students are required to submit to student housing.  In my grandson’s case, his roomie is a sophomore who is a PO (pitcher only) on the baseball team.  Both of them have similar study approaches and are 1-year apart in age.  His roomie is responsible for my grandson’s adapting to on-campus living and to “show him the ropes” so to speak.

The dorm he is in is fairly new.  Sleeping areas are separate from study areas and they share a bathroom with a stall shower in their room.

Tuition, room/board, fees, etc., runs $45,000+ this year.  Not cheap, but not prohibitive either.

I recall I was an older student serving as a mentor after my sophomore year. I think that works well for both.
In fact, our high school band did that for the incoming freshmen to help them make the big jump to the high school.

My son at OSU was lucky because the university botched up his Honors early application number dorm assignment and put him in another tower with 7 other engineering students in the 8-man apartment unit. Son and his eventual roommate both were placed into a sophomore group of 6 others in the Honors dorm. The older guys also checked in early and walked the two new guys around the area before classes started, doing things to make them part of their group. They walked a mile or so downtown to a Mexican restaurant that is authentic run by Mexicans. Kept them busy. Both my son and his roommate checked in early before move-in day! Those six guys deserve a lot of credit for my son's success.

Can anyone believe the university with the fastest supercomputer in Ohio botched up dorm assignments!

SEcond year son ended up being asked by the 6 sophomores to more into the 6-man apartment off campus because one of them was spending the semester in China for foreign study. Stayed 2 years. They graduated, and son moved into single apartment in a house near campus.

Yes, they decided that upscale customer enjoys customization to their taste. I like it to a certain degree, as my own taste is always ""off mainstream"". That's why I have hard time to find anything to really like in Lexus, Infiniti, or Acura stable. They make fine vehicles, I may even like how they drive or prefer their engineering and reliability, but they just don't make them way I'd enjoy. Want red color? Only with beige upholstery. Want a hatchback? What's ahashbak? You can really see a difference between attitudes of their salespeople. You mention an order in those Japanese Big Lux Three and they run screaming from you or give you this blank stare. This is especially true at Acura, which generally sells its cars fully loaded with very few additional options, kind of ""antiBenz"" in that regard. Lexus and Infiniti bundle them into huge packages, but their color combinations are still quite limited in comparison with BMW or Benz. You ask for a special order at Benz, Audi, or BMW dealerships, you get a smile and no problem (at least those I visited). In fact, BMW has some special colors for both exterior and interior (inlays) on many of their models that are available by order only (dealers sometimes use fake names on those orders to get them into showrooms). I remember people at BMW factory boast that ""every car is sold before it's put into production"". It's BS, of course, as they mean dealers commit to an order on their own behalf (within allotments), but it's booked like an ""ordered"" car. You pay of course, for that ""feeling special"", whatever that means to you, but it's available if you want it. At Lexus you get a nice customer lounge, pampered treatment and all, but the car itself is just about (or literally) the same as 10 thousand other cars sold this month.

The idiots at my local VW dealer lost a sure sale back in 2007; at that time you could still order a GTI with quite a few separate options.

QUESTION

I purchased a set of wiper blades at a local Canadian Tire store and on the way home, after getting gas at a local gas station, I asked the attendant if he would put the wiper blades on the car for me. He told me that he would and I gave him a two-dollar tip for doing so. The next day or two, I had to use the wipers and the wiper blade on the passenger’s side came off. I was still in the driveway so I immediately shut the wipers off. The next day, I went back to the gas station to ask why he had not put the wipers on properly. The kid was very rude and the owner of the garage told me to leave the lot. This email is to alert motorists that they should be very careful of asking anyone at gas stations to do any type of small jobs that require a brain.

A Woman from Arthur

ANSWER

To save you from any type of embarrassment, I have left your name out of this column. You have said your peace but you and I know that you have been far from honest as to what happened with your car’s wiper blades. The young man at the gas station told you that the wiper blades that you’d purchased were the wrong ones and that they were too big for your car. You told him that you wanted to have as much of the window cleaned as you possibly could so he did install them for you. When you went back to the gas station, which is also a garage, you called the lad an imbecile and went on to tell him that you wanted the two dollar tip back and that he should go back to school or he would be pumping gas for the rest of his life. The owner of the garage told you that that kind of talk was unnecessary and he asked one of the technicians to again install the wiper blade for you. In doing so, the wiper blade came back off when the technician told you to put the wipers on. The technician then told you that the wiper blades were too big and hitting one another and that they were not the proper wiper blades for your vehicle. He then offered to sell you the proper wiper blades and that is when you also went ballistic on him. That is also when the owner of the station suggested that you take your business somewhere else. That is the last that they heard from you until I contacted them. So what have we learned? I have learned that a young college person, working the summer at a gas station, should not have been scolded by a woman who was entirely at fault and who should have taken the advice from this young man when he told her that the wiper blades, that she had just purchased, were not the correct ones

Back when I was a kid growing up in So. California, there was a mom and pop Buick Dealer in our town that offered outstanding service. They would send a guy whose name was Foxy to your house on a three wheeled Harley Davidson. He would attach the motorcycle to the rear bumper and pick up and deliver cars! No charge for this service! He would park your Buick back in the garage and they would send you the bill for the service they did. Foxy loved to go down the hill in front of the high school where a crowd of us were standing before and after school. He would shut off the ignition on his cycle and turn it back on creating an explosion that made us all jump! Then he would LAUGH and cackle and ride off!"

I didn’t have much to do today so I decided to drive a Suburu Legacy 3,6R Sedan at my local Suburu Dealership.  I’ve read how satisfied nyccarguy and jmonroe have been with their Suburus that I wanted to see if it would fit my needs as a car for the future after my lease is up.

$36,784 was the MSRP of the one I drove, a 2019.  It was loaded with just about every available option and was white with black interior.  The driver’s seat was fairly comfortable and had plenty of leg and shoulder room.  The technology was exceedingly impressive for a car under $40,000.

It was pretty fast and handled quite well on turns and cornering.  I found the ride quite stiff and knew almost immediately that I would not want to drive this car on a 300-400 mile road trip - my derrière and back would be very sore on such a long drive. But for a vehicle around town and on short hops, it was more than just satisfying.

I really didn’t discus pricing with the salesman because i didn’t want to waste his time, but he admitted that management was more than willing to discount the vehicle substantially.

I don’t think I would be happy with the Suburu - due mainly to my being spoiled by MB and BMW luxury and technology.  But the next car I lease or own is not going to be a $60,000+ car - it’s going to have to be economical and under $45,000.  Buick is a possibility but a Suburu is not in my sights for my needs.
That's the car I currently drive except mine is a 2018. I still like a sportier car than you do which is evident by our past choices. I find the ride in the 3.6 a little soft actually.

Bean, I don't think you can make that blanket statement about teachers. It really depends where you are. In most NE states, if you are teaching in a suburban district, the pay is quite good with excellent benefits (on top of the pension). and of course, lots of days off. Different story in some other parts of the country, or in many inner cities. But, that is the same for most jobs.

and of course, if it is a job that is so thankless that you don't want to do it, you should find a different profession.
@stickguy, even if the pay is what you might consider ""good"", I doubt many of us would even think of doing a teachers job. It's way different than when we were in school. Teachers can't even mildly discipline students; most parents go ballistic if their ""angel"" were disciplined. Then there is the stupid standardized tests that have tied teachers hands on how they structure their curriculum. Plus constant budget cutting from the school boards. I think I can make that as a blanket statement - teaching has sadly become a dead-end job due to what society has done to it. It's a decent situation in only the top 5% of wealthy districts. For the remainder, we have made teaching a profession that smart dynamic people would not want to do, so they go into other professions.

I'm not clear on what ""...also for earned income"" means.

In some states teachers/public employees pay into social security; in some they don't pay into the pyramid scheme. Those that do not pay into SS likely have a state system that has them paying more from their salary into the retirement plan than they would were they paying into SS and the state plan.

All I can see is wasting teachers time on politically correct training to either game the system or reduce potential legal liabilities. Personally, I can see a limited role in Fed or State to set up general performance expectations and publicize district performance, but the methods and the like I believe should be firmly entrenched in the local school district and its elected board. . Also, this country has got to cut down on all the litigation. It is becoming a drag on the country. All the different levels of gov and reports in education is driving up school district overhead costs. But politicians talk one game and then pile more on to brush up their campaign PR.

Won't be sold at a Hyundai dealership. They will have stores, similar to Tesla, and they come to your home for a test drive.

The Genesis experience differs from the norm in that buyers get complimentary maintenance for five years or 60000 miles.

Book an appointment and someone comes to you, picks up your vehicle for maintenance and leaves you a loaner while it’s in the shop. It all boils down to a totally different buying experience – one which Genesis hopes will resonate with the buying public

It all sounds pretty good, but, I think if I were to spend $55000 on a Genesis, I would go just a bit more and get the car I know I will be happy with.

2366,August 18,abacomike,"I didn’t have much to do today so I decided to drive a Suburu Legacy 3,6R Sedan at my local Suburu Dealership.  I’ve read how satisfied nyccarguy and jmonroe have been with their Suburus that I wanted to see if it would fit my needs as a car for the future after my lease is up.

$36,784 was the MSRP of the one I drove, a 2019.  It was loaded with just about every available option and was white with black interior.  The driver’s seat was fairly comfortable and had plenty of leg and shoulder room.  The technology was exceedingly impressive for a car under $40,000.

It was pretty fast and handled quite well on turns and cornering.  I found the ride quite stiff and knew almost immediately that I would not want to drive this car on a 300-400 mile road trip - my derrière and back would be very sore on such a long drive. But for a vehicle around town and on short hops, it was more than just satisfying.

I really didn’t discus pricing with the salesman because i didn’t want to waste his time, but he admitted that management was more than willing to discount the vehicle substantially.

I don’t think I would be happy with the Suburu - due mainly to my being spoiled by MB and BMW luxury and technology.  But the next car I lease or own is not going to be a $60,000+ car - it’s going to have to be economical and under $45,000.  Buick is a possibility but a Suburu is not in my sights for my needs.

Retirement benefits for educators is not what it used to be.  Many States have reduced benefits for recent hires (last 10 years).

It also depends on the State in which you taught.  I receive 1/2 the amount from Illinois that a friend of mine receives from New York.  He gets over $110,000 a year in pension benefits + health insurance.  Many midwestern and plains States are quite low.  Here in Florida, pensions are abysmal.

He’s not at Nebraska - he’s at Doane University in Crete, NE, about 20 miles south of Lincoln.  It’s a small school with a $102 million endowment.  It was established in the mid 1800’s.  Several Major League Baseball players came out of that school.

If he had gone to a division I or II school instead of a division III school, he’d sit on the bench for 2 years.  He wants to play baseball - not sit on the bench.  This way, he is a starting pitcher and will play 1st base - they also want him in the batting order because he hits well - had 8 home runs in his senior year in high school.  And....this way he gets a 65% scholarship (tuition/room/board) instead of a 50% scholarship at the University of CA San Bernardino, Los Angeles or Santa Barbara.

Add the $8500 scholastic scholarship to that 65% sports scholarship, he goes to college at almost a full scholarship.

I have tears in my eyes - this was my little blond and blue-eyed grandson whose eyes lit up every time I saw him.  Now he is a man off to college.  The tears are for happiness and a little melancholia.  He’s not my “little boy” anymore. 
I don't know about Division II or III, but in Division 1 it is probably an NCAA offense if the coach picked him up at the airport. It may get the athlete and/or the college in trouble. It would be considered an extra benefit not available to all students...unless the coach picked up all students at the airport.

Most of my USA friends on here are probably unaware, but Canada is in a diplomatic tussle with Saudi Arabia right now thanks to some ill-advised public shaming of Saudi Arabia's human rights record by our idiot federal government. The Saudis did not take it well and reacted by withdrawing their ambassador among other things and ordering all their nationals who were resident in Canada to leave by the end of August.

Locally we have a good-sized number of Saudis in university here, particularly in our medical school and working as interns or residents at our hospitals. This week there have been a number of ""yard sales"" organized by the mosque for those affected to liquidate their household items, and now come the vehicles.

I respectfully disagree - to some degree. Most auto journalists will say the benchmark in the luxury class is an Audi, BMW or MB. The others have those cars in their sites....I can't think of a G3 brand that has tried to copy from Buick, Cadillac or Lexus. Who kept RWD, who kept firmer ride, who made cars that have better handling - and who is trying to do the same?

Not saying there is anything wrong with those brands, just that if you are trying to figure out what the winning formula is, you have to have the G3 in your sights.

But I can get a car that gives that BMW or MB a run for its money, spend less and not have to worry about it once the warranty expires. 

Not to mention that 80% or more of the time that I have 4 wheels under me it's not fun driving regardless of what car it is and over 80% of the time I can really get going on the road I have two wheels under me. So give me that boring Toyota for when I am stuck in traffic and I'll spend the savings on something fun with two wheels when the road is open.

Speaking of water, my Moen kitchen faucet developed an annoying drip a few weeks ago. I remembered that Moen touts a lifetime warranty so I dug out some old paperwork and amazingly found the documents that came with it along with the sales slip from 2002. I called Moen, they were very helpful, and sent out a repair kit for it. I decided to try to install it today.

Taking it apart was easy enough. That was about all the instructions that came with the parts were good for. The lady I spoke to at Moen when getting the parts sent said that she would email me a better set of instructions, which she did, and they were much better but still not 100% clear on a few points. Thankfully there are many YouTube videos on the topic and a couple of them were the most useful. Eventually after a couple of puzzlers I got it all back together and was happy that it seemed to work well with no leaks.

About an hour or so later I went to use the faucet and discovered that the cold side was now hot and vice versa. Nowhere in any of the things I read or watched did this get mentioned and there was nothing marked on the new cartridge to indicate what was what. Another web search revealed it is a common issue and thankfully an easy 5-minute fix. God forbid that any of the instructions mention that fact though!

I have to replace the cartridges in both Moen faucets in my master bathroom about once a year because they start to drip. The next time I'm going to change brands not innards.

Our town is notorious for requiring permits. We had some company give us an estimate for finishing the basement and they told us our town is only one of two where they would actually get permits before starting any work. 

One of my neighbors finished their basement themselves without getting any permits. When they went to sell the house they tried to get the transfer stamps for the sale the town saw ""finished basement"" on the paperwork and reviewed all the permits for the house and couldn't find one for the basement. So the town refused to allow the sale until a permit was issued and the basement inspected. 


It is very interesting what we found out. We had a plot plan that was drawn up by an architect for the previous owner 8 years ago before we bought the house. He had to have a new septic system put in. When my contractor presented the 2010 plot plan to the city, they rejected it and said we had to have new plans drawn up. Their reasoning was that the 2010 drawings didn't include a review area (the 25' from the wetlands where nothing can be built). The city also rejected the 2010 drawing because it didn't include a soil test. ""How can this be?"" my contractor asked. ""These plans were approved by the city in order for the septic system to be installed."" The woman my contractor was dealing with looks up the previous owner and says, ""oh. I see. He has a close family member on the board. That's how this slipped through.""

SO for those of you who are curious, we are going with pressure treated wood frame and deck flooring. The railings and spindles will be plastic (azec is the material I believe). I'll make sure to take before & after pics. Current deck is 8' off the house and 15' wide (including the stairs). New (approved) deck will be 15' off the house and 25' long (plus the stairs).

Seriously, my guess is, car hit tree which raised the right side....kind of scraped upward, and that flipped the car over. People have no idea how far you can travel in 5 seconds - when distracted!
Our hydrants have been yellow with blue hats for quite some time. Feels like the result of a study on visibility

2463,August 15,driver100,"Well, have to rely on the internet again, so I take no responsibility;
National Fire Protection Agency, commonly known as the NFPA set up NFPA code 291. This code gives guidelines pertaining to fire hydrants. The guidelines recommended are as follows, below 500GPM should be painted red, 500-999 GPM should be painted orange, 1000-1499 GPM should be painted green, and 1500 GPM or more should be painted blue. The guidelines primarily talk about the top of the hydrants and suggest painting the bottom of the hydrants yellow.

Hydrant Class
Color
(GPM) Gallons Per Minute
Class AA
Blue
1500 or more
Class A
Green
1000-1499
Class B
Orange
500-999
Class C
Red
Less than 500

I think Yellow is recommended, but some places still use red.
And, If the hydrant is not hooked to a public water system, but instead is accessing a private system (as in the case of a shared well by several houses in a specific neighborhood) the hydrant should be painted a color distinguishing it from a publicly supplied system. NFPA recommends red

2465,August 15,ab348,"Speaking of water, my Moen kitchen faucet developed an annoying drip a few weeks ago. I remembered that Moen touts a lifetime warranty so I dug out some old paperwork and amazingly found the documents that came with it along with the sales slip from 2002. I called Moen, they were very helpful, and sent out a repair kit for it. I decided to try to install it today.

Taking it apart was easy enough. That was about all the instructions that came with the parts were good for. The lady I spoke to at Moen when getting the parts sent said that she would email me a better set of instructions, which she did, and they were much better but still not 100% clear on a few points. Thankfully there are many YouTube videos on the topic and a couple of them were the most useful. Eventually after a couple of puzzlers I got it all back together and was happy that it seemed to work well with no leaks.

About an hour or so later I went to use the faucet and discovered that the cold side was now hot and vice versa. Nowhere in any of the things I read or watched did this get mentioned and there was nothing marked on the new cartridge to indicate what was what. Another web search revealed it is a common issue and thankfully an easy 5-minute fix. God forbid that any of the instructions mention that fact though!

2467,August 15,abacomike,"The State of Florida is under a “state of emergency” due to the ever-increasing expansion of something they call “red algae”!

Last year, it was prevalent on the east coast in Palm Beach County.  It is caused by the Water Management District releasing millions of gallons of water from Lake Okeechobee to rivers that empty into the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean.  Many blame the sugarcane industry because this algae is nourished by fertilizer used to grow the sugarcane.  When it rains heavily, like it does during our rainy season (July through October), run-off water from soil rich in nitrates - especially sugarcane farms - flows in streams and tributaries into Lake Okeechobee.  When the water level reaches its maximum in the lake, it must be lowered so as not to flood the Everglades and other adjacent acreage.

Right now, it is heaviest in the Tampa-St. Pete area and south to Sarasota.  The algae is red/peach in color and gives off a horrible stench.  It also kills aquatic life.  Millions of pounds of fish have washed up on the beaches on the west coast.

It seems that this red algae does something to the food fish eat and oxygenation of the water.  I have never seen it firsthand down here but it is causing havoc on the west coast.

We got estimates for when we did our deck....ended up costing close to $5000, Geeze, could have bought a used car. One company had what seemed to be a lower price, but had extras, like stainless steel screws. The second bidder gave us one price, slightly higher overall, but, they didn't insult us by even making stainless steel screws an option. We liked their more up front honest way of doing business, and they did a great job. The other thing was they had ideas, and they knew what we were trying to do.....so they could sense what we were trying to do....makes a big difference.

Our town is notorious for requiring permits. We had some company give us an estimate for finishing the basement and they told us our town is only one of two where they would actually get permits before starting any work. 

One of my neighbors finished their basement themselves without getting any permits. When they went to sell the house they tried to get the transfer stamps for the sale the town saw ""finished basement"" on the paperwork and reviewed all the permits for the house and couldn't find one for the basement. So the town refused to allow the sale until a permit was issued and the basement inspected.

Anyone already using NFL HDTV Game Pass? The price goes up to $49.95 in a little over 7 hours.


ab348 and anyone else who might be curious - I went in and tried to sign up for this knowing it sounds too good ta be true - turns out they have you give yourself a u/n and p/w because it's a program that streams NFL and NCAA college football games on the net for you. A couple things I've learned about it: 1) The streams come to you once the game is over and they cut out all of the commercials. They have ""contracts"" with over 600 TV channels supposedly. I'm still interested at this point - I could actually dig watching my Seahawk games this way. I would just have ta be careful that I don't accidentally catch the final score before I watch the stream - that wouldn't kill the buzz completely but it would knock it down a big notch.


2) It wouldn't take my credit card information. I wrote a message to their management and they said nothing about that, just that they'd take payment by PayPal, too. I've used PayPal before and found it to be useful and it worked well. There's been no suspicious activity on our credit card since I tried using it on their website and it didn't work. So that's good.

So, punt the whole idea away...or try signing up with PayPal. It is cheap, and, it would be an acceptable way to watch my favorite NFL team play their games. And our new running back, Rashaad Penny, broke a finger already and is out for 4-5 games.

Accident avoidance features might not have helped. These gadgets are great but they don't know how to make the BEST decision in any particular scenario--they just choose one for you.

Snake is right about skid marks. Nowadays the accident reconstruction folks have a harder time, because of a lack of skidmarks with ABS systems.

It takes a lot of talent, though, to flip a Chrysler 300.

I was referring to the grass parkway in front of the tree.  She traveled about 150 feet on the grass - grass was not chewed up - just left a shallow indentation where the car drove over.  In order for a car to end up on its left side, it had to hit that tree very hard on the right front.  The brunt of the collision was directly on the right front grille - not side-swiped.

Wouldn't mind juleps be a bit out of place in Colonial Williamsburg?
No idea. They seemed a regular thing at the place we were eating within the ""colony"". Our server told us as she was bringing another round that the chef had cooked up a batch of fresh spearmint syrup that morning to use in making them and the smell while that was underway was wonderful. They really were good and normally I don't even like spearmint. Of course I was with a group from Sazerac Distillery and they were using one of their really good bourbons so that might have had something to do with it.

Just don't buy waterfront property.
There are condos in our area too, Tampa, Bradenton, Riverside, Sun City Center, and you can get homes or condos for $150 to $200k. Our taxes are $2400 a year but if we were homesteaders it would be about 1/3rd less. No state taxes if you have an income in the U.S. We only have 76 units, lots of trees, windy roads, one story, 2 bdrm, 2 bthrm, vaulted ceiling, clubhouse with a pool. Condo fees are $395 a month. 1 1/2 car garage.

If you want to live near the water you will pay 2 or 3X as much, and insurance could be in the $1000s a year. We are about 20 minutes from Tampa Bay. I like that it is in a very residential area....not touristy. I think you have to be over 70 to live in Sun City Center, Walmart and drug stores have more parking spots for golf carts than cars.

Thanks, Bradd.  Yes it was short (3 nights) but I will take what I can get.

My grandson exhibits definite behaviors that indicate “self-awareness” but lacks certain skills in the awareness of others.  He basically is after self-satisfaction (eats only what he wants - doesn’t want to try different foods) and does not pick up on non-verbal cues in the facial expressions of those he comes in contact with.

At times he’ll burst out verbally when something attracts his attention - like a plane taking off - but does not understand that the outburst is very distracting to other individuals in the car.  My son is very in tune with him and corrects his behaviors in a strong, fatherly approach.  

He is high functioning.  He spent most of his time playing online games with headphones.  He was well-behaved at the movies and at the restaurants. He is adorable but does not like to be touched.  He did come over and hug me when I dropped him off at the airport when I opened my arms to say goodbye but resisted my kiss to his forehead.

Seems like the rule is....drive faster than average when going forward.....go much slower than average when backing up.
Funny, the lessons I learned from the recent incident indicate to avoid backing up when possible, but when you have to, do so with above average speed, acceleration, and authority (burn rubber with 2WD). The less seconds you are in reverse, the less chance someone coming out of ""nowhere"" to hit you while you'll be at fault.

I recall the scene in Tarantino's ""Death Proof'"" movie where Kurt Russell's character backs out of a parking spot in the correct manner I'm thinking here. The female characters in the movie react to the stunt with a reference to ""small manhood."" With AWD I won't be burning rubber though; less attention drawn that way. Exhibition of speed violations probably have more to do with noise and spinning tires than speed itself.

Cities don't care about wasting money. Government seems to think money grows on trees.

On my current project at work, the City decided they didn't like the reviewed and approved permitted drawings for the traffic signal intersection improvements we were doing as part of the new building upgrades ""deal"" with the City.

They said, yes, it was approved, permitted, but we didn't really look at those slopes, they don't meet our current ADA guidelines. We had already re-poured curb, gutter, and sidewalk. The owner is going to pay for this.

So far, no one from the City has offered to compensate anyone for the delays, demo of newly poured concrete, rework, and errors on their part. I suppose they could ultimately point the finger at the Civil Engineer for doing it wrong in the first place. However, there is no feasible solution. The final conclusion after forcing 3 revised sets of drawings that all don't work is to ""return to existing and match the existing asphalt grades and slopes."" If you don't make it worse, sometimes that's OK.

2597,August 14,abacomike,"I was driving back to my Condo using the main road inside our complex. I stopped at the stop sign a few hundred feet from the entrance to my Condo Village when I noticed a woman driving a black Chrysler 300 sedan pass the stop sign opposite me and made a turn doing at least 25 miles per hour and began to speed up once she completed the turn in front of me. I make my right turn and saw that car jump the right curb and crashed its right front end into a Royal Palm Tree and it flipped over onto its left side trapping the driver inside the car. I stopped about 100 feet behind the car and immediately called 911.

I walked quickly over to the car and saw that the woman was jammed against the driver's door and I had no way of getting her out because the car was on its left side. I told her to be calm and that I had called the 911 emergency line and the police, fire and ambulance were on their way. There was nothing else I could do.

I got back into my car and drove over to my parking space and then walked back to the car that h ad flipped onto its left side. I have n ever seen anything like that - a car flipped onto its left side against the curb of the street. When the fire department arrived about 4 minutes later, then go on top of the right side of the car, opened the door, and go the woman out of the car through the right passenger door. She seemed OK but the EMT's decided to take her to the emergency room anyway.

I don't know what was wrong with the driver, but my guess is that she either was intoxicated, over-medicated or reacting to a medication, on her cell phone talking or texting, or some mechanical problem with the car. She obviously lost control of the car after her fast turn and high speed.

Unfortunately, I did not take a photo of the car when it was on its left side, but I did just take a photo(s) of the car being hauled off by a tow truck.

The driver was not a resident - she was a care worker because of her uniform and was in her 30's - at least that's what I saw. Dangersous living here in South Florida.

I may have told this story before. My sister was a rural route carrier for the Post Office in Colorado. One of the places she delivered mail to had this dog that would run up to her car, clamp down on the back bumper of her car and wouldn't let go. She had to slowly drive away dragging the dog until it let go. 

There was a theory offered by zoologists that a car's hubcaps or spinners or wire wheels, glinting in the sun, reminds the dog of their ancient pack-hunting ways, as they became transfixed on the hoofs of their prey.

For example, if my car stopped itself because a dog ran out in front of me, I would be quite annoyed. I would much rather hit a dog at 5mph than have my car stop me. The dog learns nothing good from the car stopping.

Yes, the fact she didn't stop till at least 2 car length past me tends to indicate that, in addition to the damage she did to her car which fared far worse than mine. I know the Civic doesn't have 6-piston Brembos, but it's also a pretty light car that can brake fast.

The problem with blaming speed though is that all she had to do was hit the brakes, or the gas, or swerve a bit more to avoid me! Who knows, maybe she did swerve a bit and in an epic error of judgment didn't swerve hard enough to make tire noises and/or avoid me. Or maybe she sped up thinking she'd get by me and the Civic's little motor failed her.

If she was going 40 then maybe excessive speed had a role. I think speed was a factor for her, even at 20, as she obviously wasn't paying attention. You certainly shouldn't drive fast if your going to text and drive. You shouldn't even drive slow and text and drive though.

Given the narrow travel lanes between parking lot spots, I'd say she was going too fast for her.

At ten miles per hour, it takes approximately 27 feet from the time a driver sees an obstacle until they can completely stop the car. Ten is the max reasonable parking lot speed. Faster than that is excessive. At 20 mph, the distance increases to 63 feet. So, not only was the driver not seeing and reacting to a clear threat (e.g., if you were going ""1 mph"" as you backed, it took a long time for you to reach the position of impact), but also clearly going faster than anything that could be considered a reasonable speed.

Herding dogs chase cars because it’s part of their herding nature. It’s very difficult to unlearn that behavior. And certainly one trial learning won’t work on them.

Faster than that is excessive. At 20 mph, the distance increases to 63 feet. So, not only was the driver not seeing and reacting to a clear threat (e.g., if you were going ""1 mph"" as you backed, it took a long time for you to reach the position of impact), but also clearly going faster than anything that could be considered a reasonable speed.
I agree with that, unfortunately Geico mentioned that ""speed"" is difficult to prove without eye witnesses. She was middle aged, have to admit I was expecting to see a young dude pop out of the car.

Herding dogs chase cars because it’s part of their herding nature. It’s very difficult to unlearn that behavior. And certainly one trial learning won’t work on them. My friend’s border. collie just had to be put in the house when company was expected. And in any case, I would certainly rather have my car stop than hit a dog.
Yes, it is a choice we all make. Most herding dogs do pretty well with the car chasing thing. It's the dumb ones that run out in front of the cars to ""chase"" them that generally end up in the doggie morgue. This was one of those, but it didn't end up there thanks to my efforts. And, really, that's my point: A program and sensors cannot read situations to determine the best course of action; all they can do is make the same response to a given set of input parameters.

I swear I couldn't see damage on the Lincoln, and the Geo had to be hauled away by tow truck. No injuries to either party, but the Lincoln driver said the car had issues after the crash, maybe frame-related as the alignment was always off after that, and they soon replaced it with a 1965 Cadillac. Fun taste in cars. This person is now roughly 60, and drives a Jeep Liberty - fun car days gone.

When I was a little kid, my mom had some kind of parking lot run-in while in her big T-Bird, I think a Brady Bunch type event where both cars backed out at the same time and bumped each other. I think the other car was an early Celebrity or something, which had some damage, while the T-Bird had nary a scratch due to being built like a tank with thick bumpers. I don't recall the verdict on that, but I think something happened with insurance.

By the description of the damage to her vehicle she had to be behind you or just almost so when you started backing out. Otherwise how would you have damaged her car doors. If you were at least 3/4ths of the way out and she came by and hit you her damage would have been far more towards the front. based on where you say her damage was I would tend to believe your insurance company did the right thing.

Insurance companies aren't charities, they will do what they can to maximize profit, there's little oversight and even less recourse.

I think not looking can parallel with speed - if people looked, they might go slower or not whip around blind corners etc. My dashcams have a fairly wide field of vision. You should look into it, if I lived in your area, I would. I don't see myself ever moving away from having it, both for peace of mind and the chance of catching some wacky weird event.

OK, so I'm trying to avoid this ever happening again, and the idea of backing into spots did come up. I do fail to see how it helps much, as with both methods, you are backing either out of or into a space at least once.

Only an empty parking lot where you can pull froward into the space in the adjacent lane that your facing forward improves this. I suppose your backing INTO a space rather than OUT Of one, but the mere act of backing up makes you vulnerable to being deemed at-fault should anyone ram into you. I want to avoid reverse gear.

My father was recently hit by a Toyota driver while he was reversing and parallel parking INTO a parking space. The Toyota driver decided he was taking too long apparently, and rammed directly into his front left side that was still sticking out as he was backing into the space. Even in this case, where he was basically rear-ended to the front left side, the mere act of backing up made him 50% at fault according to his insurance company.

He probably should have fought harder, but I understand giving up."

It certainly appears that way, but the problem is I hadn't ""just started backing out."" I was backing out for quite some time already before colliding with her. She was no where near me when I started backing out. Want to do the math on how many feet of distance you cover at 20 MPH (admittedly a guess at her speed) over let's say, 5 seconds? She came from very far away to hit me the way she did. She was not in the proper right lane. I don't think she tried to swerve to avoid me which only leaves two possibilities:

1) She sought out to hit me as I was backing out, and aimed for just behind me.

2) She was in the middle or center left of the two narrow lanes in the parking lot, and not in her proper travel lane. If she was driving on the proper side of the travel lane of the parking lot, she would have hit my doors, instead of vice versa.

3) She was most definitely carrying some speed, I'm pretty sure my guessitimate of 20 is good +/- 5 MPH. At 1 MPH, no one that is parked should be able to hit the front half of the side of your vehicle. That tends to show the coast was not clear IMO. If your back half is hit, that favors the woman. I think insurance companies just look at who was moving and who reached the point of impact first. Since she was going 15 to 20X faster than me, she got there first, but I most definitely had to ""pull back in"" after getting out of my car, because it was in the way, precisely as I've remembered and described the events.

Unfortunately for me, there were several people nearby, but they did not see what happened, they only looked after hearing the sound of a collision, but they were in the parking lot very close by, too bad! I definitely asked them if they saw what she did because an eye witness would have been helpful.

I sort of see the logic, just a small benefit I think. Even so, I think I will start doing it, at least a majority of the time.

The problem is in my recent example, the parking lot for the restaurant was shaped sort of like the letter ""P""
I was facing where the loop meets the center of the straight line. I was backing out in a straight line, because the travel lane from the looping portion of the P was behind me, so I could back out for several car lengths if I had wanted to. The coast behind me was indeed clear, I wasn't backing out into the unknown, but I'll have to really watch my sides for much longer now. I won't assume other drivers are idiots, I'll assume I'm invisible I guess.

I see the same vulnerabilities when backing into a space on arrival, until your protected by cars on all sides.

depends I think on the angle the car is coming at. If it makes a sharp turn you get less notice. But based on backing out of my driveway, with cars coming down the road at normal speed (say 25-30), with a clearer view it gives a pretty good heads up.

Do you think braking to a stop milliseconds before impact would save you completely? They could argue your already in the way of their travel lane, and they just couldn't stop in time. Being stopped helps, because be definition you are no longer backing up, you are on more equal footing then, but, I could still see you getting 50% blame in such a case. Even better would be a system that could floor the throttle for a split second and put you in forward gear a;; at the same time to shoot forward about 10' as fast as possible; moving you out of harms way.

The problem is if she didnt swerve then you hit her as you were backing out plain and simple, otherwise her damage would have been on her front end. Seeing that your contact with that other car is at the front door tells me that you backed into her as she was passing you. 

Now at 1 MPH you would be traveling at about a foot and a half or so a second. this means you would travel between at least 2 to 3 feet into her path before she could have even touched the brakes. Add that to the stopping distance it is easy to see that you may have not seen her when you started to back up.

2) She was in the middle or center left of the two narrow lanes in the parking lot, and not in her proper travel lane. If she was driving on the proper side of the travel lane of the parking lot, she would have hit my doors, instead of vice versa.

3) She was most definitely carrying some speed, I'm pretty sure my guessitimate of 20 is good +/- 5 MPH. At 1 MPH, no one that is parked should be able to hit the front half of the side of your vehicle. That tends to show the coast was not clear IMO. If your back half is hit, that favors the woman. I think insurance companies just look at who was moving and who reached the point of impact first. Since she was going 15 to 20X faster than me, she got there first, but I most definitely had to ""pull back in"" after getting out of my car, because it was in the way, precisely as I've remembered and described the events.

Unfortunately for me, there were several people nearby, but they did not see what happened, they only looked after hearing the sound of a collision, but they were in the parking lot very close by, too bad! I definitely asked them if they saw what she did because an eye witness would have been helpful.

The problem is if she didnt swerve then you hit her as you were backing out plain and simple, otherwise her damage would have been on her front end. Seeing that your contact with that other car is at the front door tells me that you backed into her as she was passing you. 

Now at 1 MPH you would be traveling at about a foot and a half or so a second. this means you would travel between at least 2 to 3 feet into her path before she could have even touched the brakes. Add that to the stopping distance it is easy to see that you may have not seen her when you started to back up.

I would really like to hear her side of the story. But by your description of the damage there is not much I can come up with. 


She managed to sneak her front end behind me ""just in time"" for me to back into her. Hence the damage to my right corner despite backing out straight. This is the essence of your argument and what I think ultimately won her case for her, the fact is I was still moving rearward when she got behind me.

Saying she's a terrible driver for allowing her car to be hit by a car moving 1 MPH for over 5 seconds at a constant speed and direction, is a true statement, but it doesn't change fault in the eyes of insurance company.

She was equally as bad or as good as a completely blind driver, and just happened to have gotten lucky with her position and timing. I was easily about 10' into the path of travel before I was hit, but since I was still moving, you can technically say we hit each other, and she had the right of way.

At the point where I was hit I was so far back I actually was well past the point of ""letting my guard down"" regarding side impacts, and was merely looking directly behind me. Anyone with 2 working eyeballs that was actually actively using them would not have impacted my vehicle, of that I'm 100% certain.

I am not attempting to describe “at fault” blame in my several posts.  My car stops - period!  If you had my cross traffic/pedestrian system on your car, you would not have hit that woman’s car.  She might have hit you - but you wouldn’t have hit her - like you did.

Just accept the fact that you backed into her while she was driving legally.  

Let me fix your statement so that it makes sense:

""Just accept the fact that you backed into her while she was driving with right of way precedence legally.

.

Simple physics should make it easy for a car moving 10 to 20X faster to avoid one moving 10 to 20 times slower!

Particularly at parking lot speeds, how long should one reasonably take to react to a backing out vehicle? Seems like a sure-fire way to inspire insurance fraud. If I wanted to commit insurance fraud, now I know how. Just target a vehicle backing out of a parking space, and make sure you fly by with just inches to spare to make it seem like they backed into you!

I'd have to log back into Insider. And I think one time I had to log back into Forums, but another time I didn't have to log into forums. I use the cookie et al cleaners because a couple of sites I visit limit how many free stories you can view. Clearing everything takes away however they keep a record of my visits, so I start with a clean slate after a couple of days.
For those sites you want to routinely clear the cookies have you tried using your browsers private browsing setting? I think IE calls it Inprivate browsing and Google calls it Incognito. With those your history and any cookies for that session gets wiped when you close that window.

2684,August 13,andres3,"Well, I'm sad to report the Alltrack has been violated. This one, as I figured, knowing insurance companies, was pinned on me, despite being 95% caused by the other female driver.

I was backing out (game over; Insurance company stops listening at this point). I was going very slow, slower than I usually back out, maybe only 1 MPH (but speed kills )

I was at least 3/4 of the way out of my spot, well established in the lane, and had just begun to let my guard down looking at the rear view camera screen as I had decided I could back out straight all the way since there was parking lot roadway behind me, and not more parked cars. Normally at that point one would turn sharply to get out of the perpendicular parking spaces. In comes the lady from the side, maybe going as much as 20X faster than me, and boom. My right rear corner is hit, her two right doors are ""smashed in starting on the front of the passenger door."" How she didn't see me when I was so far backed out is beyond me. I was flabbergasted and dumbfounded. Clearly she was distracted, but won't admit to it further than saying ""I didn't see you."" She must of been 2 car lengths past me before stopping! She must have not been driving on the right side of the parking lot roadway either to have avoided broadsiding me. Luckily for me, she bascially pushed my car diagonally out of the way an inch or two, so the damage is all localized as minor scuffing to the rear bumper under the taillight assembly, a hairline crack in the taillight, and a tiny scuff above the taillight, with holes and damage to the plastics underneath the painted bumper.

Unfortunately for me, I was in reverse, and backing out, although my motion was near motionless as compared to the Earth. Still, I couldn't honestly say I was stopped, and I knew that was my doom. Sure enough, Geico caved in with little pressure and assessed me blame as I had predicted.

I honestly think the only way to have avoided this type of driver is to have used MORE SPEED. Back out with authority, making the time you are backing out less, and therefore giving fewer seconds to those that will target you like a heat sinking missile while you are vulnerable to insurance ""rules of thumb."" Had I done that, I either could have avoided her by continuing to back out faster and faster out of her path, or, at least, been hit broadside which would be more her fault as she apparently wins by beating me to the spot (20 MPH vs. 1 MPH), I was a sitting duck!

Unbelievable she ruins my streak of no-at-fault accidents in a parking lot where I was moving at a slow 1 MPH and nothing was behind me, until there was of course. Plain 7:30 PM dusk; still plenty of light out; no need for headlights yet. Wish I would have got a picture of her car, much more damaged along both doors she must have dragged around my rear corner.

Absolutely. I take blame when blame is due. Like when I was a teenager and rear-ended somebody at about 5 MPH; thankfully there was no visible damage. My car had a damaged license plate and that's about it. I suppose the license plate frame showed plastic stress ""coloring"" from being compressed.

I'm still thinking the photos show more of a ""side"" impact than they do my rear going into her. The damage clearly shows fast motion from the right to the left. Not from being compressed inward.

According to Geico, this one was, as it apparently serves my interests to just accept 100% liability so that they don't come after me for ""more."" I don't think I'm buying what Geico was selling there in telling me that, but that's what they said.

My belief is that accepting 100% liability for small claims following generic rules of thumb serves only insurance company interests, as it keeps them from having to do any real investigative work in assessing fault. Insurance companies give each other the same courtesy, so it balances out for them, while assessing far more blame to driver's that don't deserve it, at the same time as assigning far less blame to those that do deserve blame, but receive none.

I'm not referring to my own case with this statement. I've seen this repeatedly from other claims I've heard about or seen, as well as my own from decades past.

I really need to get a dash cam, front and rear, but I'm afraid without left and right cams, they'd of been useless in my most current situation.

Maybe a Google 360 Degree cam is needed. She couldn't have been in my rear frame for more than a split second flash as she whizzed by me. I suppose in a major case you could pull frames of video per second to assess her speed. She couldn't have made more than a few frames of video even in the wide angle lens such as that of the car's own camera (but no video) view.

But as we all know, I'm not into blaming speed, I just think she wasn't looking. How do you not see a white car with rear reverse lights, and rear brake lights on? My foot was most definitely on the brake, not because I saw her about to be flying into me, but because I was backing up slowly with a DSG auto transmission at idle. Without brakes, you'd back up much faster than I did.

By the description of the damage to her vehicle she had to be behind you or just almost so when you started backing out. Otherwise how would you have damaged her car doors. If you were at least 3/4ths of the way out and she came by and hit you her damage would have been far more towards the front. based on where you say her damage was I would tend to believe your insurance company did the right thing.

OK, so I'm trying to avoid this ever happening again, and the idea of backing into spots did come up. I do fail to see how it helps much, as with both methods, you are backing either out of or into a space at least once.

Only an empty parking lot where you can pull froward into the space in the adjacent lane that your facing forward improves this. I suppose your backing INTO a space rather than OUT Of one, but the mere act of backing up makes you vulnerable to being deemed at-fault should anyone ram into you. I want to avoid reverse gear.

My father was recently hit by a Toyota driver while he was reversing and parallel parking INTO a parking space. The Toyota driver decided he was taking too long apparently, and rammed directly into his front left side that was still sticking out as he was backing into the space. Even in this case, where he was basically rear-ended to the front left side, the mere act of backing up made him 50% at fault according to his insurance company.

He probably should have fought harder, but I understand giving up.

Before the Toyota, they owned VWs - an early 60's Beetle and a '68 Squareback. The Squareback had an engine failure which put them in the market.

I remember going with my dad to the Mazda lot and looking at both the RX-2 and RX-3, so he was pretty adventerous when it came to my mom's cars. Even though my dad drove a '70 Chevy pickup, I don't think he ever considered a domestic brand for my mom.

2704,August 12,ab348,"These last few posts brought back a funny memory for me. Back around 1969 or so I got a subscription to Road Test magazine. It claimed to be different from R&T, C&D and Motor Trend in that it did not take advertising from car manufacturers. It was a fairly bare-bones publication but I liked their different point of view.

One of the things that they did early on was test a lot of those new Japanese cars that were just making an impact. They seemed to generally love them and gave most of them favorable reviews. One I recall clearly was the Mazda 808, the piston-engine version of the RX-3, which they raved about. We had a newly-minted Mazda dealer in town - the typical style back then of being in a converted service station - and when the parents were in car-buying mode around 1971 I talked them into going to look at one there because it came in a station wagon version, which Dad thought would be useful in his real estate business.

Aside from the small size, what struck both them and me the most was how cheap everything seemed, from the thickness of the metal and the sound the doors made when closing, to the plasticky seat and door panel upholstery, pretty much everything. They didn't even bother taking one for a drive after sitting in and looking at them in the small showroom, and I couldn't really disagree. It made me wonder a bit about Road Test magazine.

Later on I saw a letter to the editor complaining about their bias towards Japanese cars they reviewed. The author said that he had sent them a cheque for a subscription and when the cancelled cheque came back from the bank it had a cancellation stamp from the Bank of Tokyo. It made me wonder just how independent they actually were.

We had dinner last night at NYY Steak House (same restaurant as the one at Yankee Stadium) and then went over to GameStop. Troy (grandson) just had to have a few games for his player at home so I melted and bought him a few. Those things are darn expensive - $60.00 each. Ouch.

So, we are going to have some lunch here at my condo and soon I will be all alone once again. Quiet is nice after the last three days - but will miss them both dearly.

45 years ago today, my folks bought the car that I would learn to drive in. On August 12, 1973 we went to Lunsford Toyota on Oxnard Blvd and picked out a brown Toyota Corona as our new car for my mom. I think they paid $2900 for it. That car lasted 8 years, and I have quite a few memories of it. I remember my mom being able to fill the gas tank with $5. I remember adding a cassette deck to it so I could play the latest songs in it. I remember taking my driving test in it. I also remember the day when I was involved in an accident on my way to high school that ultimately totaled it.

August 12, 1973 also happened to be my dad's 38th birthday. He would have been 83 today. I've been thinking about, and missing him, quite a lot these past few days.

Happy birthday, dad!
I learned to drive on a Toyota Corona! My mom bought hers in 1969. Had to go all the way to LA to get it. It was a great car that was basically handed down from one family member to the next.

In my case, I'd do a cookie cleaning using a couple of programs I have, then start over logging in. I'd have to log back into Insider. And I think one time I had to log back into Forums, but another time I didn't have to log into forums.

I use the cookie et al cleaners because a couple of sites I visit limit how many free stories you can view. Clearing everything takes away however they keep a record of my visits, so I start with a clean slate after a couple of days.

Another possibility is that the auto-fill is not putting in the password you want. I've had that trouble with a Malibu forum I frequent.

Another technique might be to log in using another browser. I have Chrome, Firefox, and Edge on this computer. So I can switch to another one if there's a problem in Chrome, e.g..

2739,August 11,abacomike,"I want to preface my comment with the fact that I have not been to a movie theater to watch a movie in over 6 years - I have Netflix, HBO, SHO, STARZ, EPIX, to name a few, on my cable at home. So watching movies or ordering movies currently playing is what I do in order to watch in the comfort of my home.

Now for my comment:

My grandson wants to go to the movies this afternoon to see ""Ant Man and The Wasp"" (a movie I have been wanting to see for as long as I can remember - UGH!). So, being computer literate, as I am, I go online and found a brand new theater just 5 minutes from the house. I look up the movie and start to select my seats. I follow all the instructions and the total amount came to $38.96. Did I understand and read that right? $38.96? You've got to be kidding. So I look at the individual pricing and for adults (13 years old and above) the price per ticket is $11.50 and for seniors (like me) the price is $9.98. When you add taxes and ""convenience fee"", you are at $38.96. I almost excreted a ""brick""! Just under $40.00 for 3 people to watch a movie.

Then, of course, they will want popcorn, soda, pretzel, hot dogs - whatever, and I am probably closer to $100.00. My cable bill is only $89.00 (the HOA pays $36.00) a month which includes ""Blast"" internet, expanded cable, STARZ, NETFLIX, HBO, SHO, EPIX, all on their X-1 system with HD. See where I'm going.

You guys who have kids or like to go to the movies with your SO or spouse must cringe every time you go to the movie theater. That's big bucks for a 2 hour movie in a theater with kids screaming, yelling, running up and down the aisle...., etc.

So, rather than get reserved seats right now, I figured I would buy the tickets at the theater and save a few bucks, but before we leave, we will check seating to make sure we can get some halfway decent seats. If we can't, I'll have to reserve the seats.

This trip to fly my son and grandson in from CA for a 3 night stay has already cost me $2500 if you include my son's overdue phone bill balance, new phone fees, dinner Friday, dinner last night, shoes and clothes for both as my gift, movies, etc.. This does not include my electric bill which will be outrageous since they like it cool in the house and leave all the TV's on, lights on, and very long hot showers.

But I'm not through - there is still dinner out tonight at the Steak House, breakfast out tomorrow morning, lunch out tomorrow afternoon, and then they leave for home at about 5:00 PM.

But then I remember it's only money and I don't get to see my son or grandson very often. UGH!

I am an AMC Stubs member and take advantage of what it offers. I tend to earn a good bit of reward money, for one thing. It also allows free upgrades at the concession stand. We ONLY buy popcorn and I have water bottles in my jacket pockets (they crank the AC, so a jacket is necessary in all seasons), and that means I get a large bucket for the price of a medium. The bucket comes with free refills. We always go to the first show of the day, which is significantly cheaper: $6.50 a seat. They are also currently running a special where every show on Tuesdays is just $5. My wife almost never goes, so, for example, last Tuesday was $25 total for 3 tickets and a bucket of popcorn ($9).

There are a lot of 6 cylinder cars out there that can eat that 69 Boss. Now I had a friend in high school that had a 69 Boss 429 and if memory recalls it was a bit faster to 60 than 7.1 seconds. But note that the 429 engine was said to be able to run at 9k RPM without fail but Ford limited the RPMs to a little ove 6k.

But to be fair, getting us forums types transitioned was not the purpose of the new registration popup. That's all about signing up new Insiders going forward (who I KNOW you will all welcome warmly when they show up in the forums).

That being said, things went about as seamless as anything like this could go. Thanks again for helping US out by keeping an eye out for things that appear to be getting wonky.

One of my favorite ""transition"" stories that illustrates how even decent, law-abiding-instruction-following types... like ME... can make a wrong turn.

I forget what year it was that PA started to let you turn right on a red light, but it was an adjustment. I was very hesitant at first because I knew other drivers might not be used to cars pulling out while they were approaching a green light.

Then, we went through a stage of people honking behind you if you didn't IMMEDIATELY turn right on red. Just because you CAN, don't mean you HAVE to... but back to the point...

So we're all used to right-on-red and I'm on a mid-morning errand from where I work at the time with another employee, and I pull up to the red light, look both ways and make a LEFT. There was no traffic, so no drama. (No nearby officer either) But I had gotten USED to pulling up to a red light, stopping, and then making my turn if the traffic was clear.

Just like the popup... SIGN IN... SIGN IN.... SIGN UP.....sign in

Easy to see how some mistakes happen
Within the 5 Boroughs of New York City you CANNOT make a Right Turn on Red (except for a handful of intersections. In New York State, you CAN make a Right Turn on Red. In certain cities in New York State (like White Plains) you can make a Left Turn on Red from a One Way Street onto another One Way Street.

Here in Nova Scotia (I think some other jurisdictions too) you can make a left turn on red if it is an intersection of two one-way streets where it would be allowed on a green light.

More thoughts on Mustangs.

I'm watching ""What's my Car Worth"" where they are appraising a 69 Mustang Boss 429. That's a massive motor yet the listed 0-60 time is only 7.1 seconds. A modern stock GT could eat its' lunch. Whoda thunk?

From what the 69 went for at auction it looks like a modern car is about $350,000 cheaper too.
It is easy for the young'uns to forget that for many years a sub-7 second 0 to 60 time meant you were driving a very fast car. Most muscle cars in that era were around that time, and in many cases were not easy to drive in daily use (think of the Chrysler Hemis in the late '60s). It is only in recent years that blistering 0-60 times became more common for affordable everyday cars.

The Boss 429 was sold to homologate the motor for NASCAR Grand National(Now Monster Energy NASCAR Cup) racing .It was never known as a quarter mile terror, it being somewhat nose heavy.

As I've mentioned before I have a 1991 magazine that is a compilation of road tests from the old Hi-Performance Cars magazine. The fastest 1/4 mile time was a 12.5 posted by a 1969 Motion Performance big block Camaro- with 4.10 gears, uncapped headers and slicks. Aside from that car most of the others put up 1/4 mile ETs in the 13.5-14.5 second range. Those times are on the SLOW side of average for performance cars these days. My 2007 Mazdaspeed 3 could run in the low 14 second range all day long- and that's with a 2.3 liter turbo that averaged 26+ mpg over the 8 years and 158,000 miles I had it

Which is all the more amazing given how clean and fuel efficient modern motors are. The 429 probably got 10 on the highway vs. 30+ in my car. What a great time to be alive . At the apex of ICE just before everything goes electric and self driving.

Yes, they are. And thanks for the kind words, Kirstie. I only get to see my son once a year and my grandsons infrequently. I wish I could fly - doctors just won't let me. It's 3 hours to DFW and another 3 hours to PSP. Then add an hour or two for layover, and it just is too much stress on my body. I have a deep vein thrombosis (blood clot) in my left femoral vein. That's why I take blood thinners. Sitting for that long a time in one spot is dangerous, according to the doctors. So, I take what ever I can get from bringing them here from California.

It spins the waiting circle around, then lands me on the same page Dan Hood gets sent to - asking for our screen name, car we drive, etc. If there was something we could click on on that page that would let us in, we'd be in like Flint!
As someone else pointed out, you may have used the create a new account instead of the link to sign in when you already have an account. The social media login and account creation options do tend to visually dominate that popup

2813,August 10,PF_Flyer,"But to be fair, getting us forums types transitioned was not the purpose of the new registration popup. That's all about signing up new Insiders going forward (who I KNOW you will all welcome warmly when they show up in the forums).

That being said, things went about as seamless as anything like this could go. Thanks again for helping US out by keeping an eye out for things that appear to be getting wonky.

One of my favorite ""transition"" stories that illustrates how even decent, law-abiding-instruction-following types... like ME... can make a wrong turn.

I forget what year it was that PA started to let you turn right on a red light, but it was an adjustment. I was very hesitant at first because I knew other drivers might not be used to cars pulling out while they were approaching a green light.

Then, we went through a stage of people honking behind you if you didn't IMMEDIATELY turn right on red. Just because you CAN, don't mean you HAVE to... but back to the point...

So we're all used to right-on-red and I'm on a mid-morning errand from where I work at the time with another employee, and I pull up to the red light, look both ways and make a LEFT. There was no traffic, so no drama. (No nearby officer either) But I had gotten USED to pulling up to a red light, stopping, and then making my turn if the traffic was clear.

Just like the popup... SIGN IN... SIGN IN.... SIGN UP.....sign in

I'm watching ""What's my Car Worth"" where they are appraising a 69 Mustang Boss 429. That's a massive motor yet the listed 0-60 time is only 7.1 seconds. A modern stock GT could eat its' lunch. Whoda thunk?

From what the 69 went for at auction it looks like a modern car is about $350,000 cheaper too.

2819,August 9,imidazol97,"The problems in the transition seem to be related to inconsistency in the emails that we users had in Insider and the old Forums.

We were given info about the upcoming changes. I went to Insider and found my current email didn't work because my account was under a different email. Signed in as a new account with current Old Forums email, before the merge.

I had noted that first time on my 2005 XP Chrome (orphaned Chrome) signing in after cookies cleaning to speed up the old thing, I had to sign in twice: once for Insider and then once for the new Forums.

Today I rebooted one of my Win10 laptops and I had to sign in to Insider but was then already in the new Forums. Without having to go through a second log in there.

It works.

Thanks to the hosts for their monitoring and helping those who have hit problems. I compare the prep work here by the hosts and the real time help for the problems some are having here to the lack of help on Microsoft products, for instance.

I had problems with Windows 10 last Fall and Winter with the automatic updates that wouldn't install right, but kept trying several times a day requiring reboots for more than 15 minutes as each try processed. The only help there was a questions forums Microsoft operates with Microsoft related folks who have different solutions on how to make the updates work. I had to find the problem myself for my computer by doing clean boots--other folks had different problems causing update failures.

The sorting issue is being caused by an issue with the tagging which is what the sorts are based on. Nothing at all to do with the login. It's been reported to the people who take care of those issues.

For now, if you're looking for discussions on any particular topic or make/model, just remember the newer discussions will be found on the LAST page of discussions until the tagging issue is resolved.

Make use of those Bookmarks by clicking that star at the top on the discussion page to make it gold and then you can click My Discussions to follow your list of Bookmarks. (which will be sorted by latest post, as usual)

Hey, that's what I was thinking about doing. Edmunds doesn't care about a member having a valid email, they just want one. How are they going to get redemption if you keep creating new accounts with bogus emails, passwords and user names?

We do care. We now have more sophisticated ways of checking whether an email is valid. Also, as opposed to the previous system, this one won't let you register with a temporary or shared email address (e.g., mailinator), which are preferred by spammers everywhere.

Not sure what your point is. If a person thinks Edmunds is full of incompetent fools, I'd probably not bother being here. FYI, I can fix the problem stated. I just can't do it here because it requires some communication that probably should remain private.

Ok, so I screwed up. I tried to sign up as an insider under a new email. I got an email confirmation. Then I backtracked and tried to use the old AOL email to sign in that I haven’t looked at in YEARS. It won’t let me. I get the same message as @houdini1. Should I just sign up as a new user with a new email or is there a chance at redemption?
The trick for an old email address that you don't really use anymore is that you need to update your email address first, then do the rest of that stuff. Not that this helps now, but I would think the admins could simply delete the new account and set you back to the old account only.

xwesx - those who are having issues used a different email to sign up for Insider than they used for their forums profiles. The system has no way to match them. But, no sense in logging out if you don't have to!

UPDATE: Same experience, Imidazol. I'll find out whether that's intentional or accidental. May be intentional as there's not a lot of crossover right now between Insider users and forums users.

It's odd that you couldn't change your old email address. A couple of years ago I wandered into the ""Profile"" section here in the forums and saw that the defunct email address I had used years before to sign up here was still listed. But it was an editable field, so I changed it to my new email address and it took it. The next time I had to log in to the forums I entered that along with my old original password and all was well.

What happens here for you when you go into the profile section and try to edit that old email address?

Houdini, I am impressed!  To allow the variables in life to expose you to the world as “Dan Hood” is magnanimous!  This feels like a “James Bond” Novel where code names are revealed.

It's odd that you couldn't change your old email address. A couple of years ago I wandered into the ""Profile"" section here in the forums and saw that the defunct email address I had used years before to sign up here was still listed. But it was an editable field, so I changed it to my new email address and it took it. The next time I had to log in to the forums I entered that along with my old original password and all was well.

What happens here for you when you go into the profile section and try to edit that old email address?
For the fun of it I am making this post from my PC before I logged out then back in. So other than my red face mug shot, when I looked at my old profile I see the old (incorrect) email and I still see all my badges along with 330 Like's and 661 LOL's.

Earlier today the problems surfaced when I logged out then back in with my dumb phone. That is when I had to become @jmonroe1, which BTW doesn't even show on the pick list when you enter the @ sign on the old site but I see there is a jmonroe4. Talk about a wannabe, that guy is at the top of that list.

Now to answer your question when I went into the profile section on this new system. I don't see an editable spot for your email now like on the old system but like I have said before I couldn't correct the old incorrect email anyway, so nothing really lost now with no editable email box. All I see is 5 boxes for providing info.

Screen Name
Vehicle(s) I own
Location
More about me and
Vehicle(s) that interest me

I am not going to log out and then back in on my PC until the system glitches and I have to. So, when you see me show up as @jmonroe1 you'll know I am making that post from my dumb phone and when I show up as my old self (@jmonroe), you'll know I am posting from my PC. Clear as mud, right? This place deserves my seamless posting scheme.

The system is doing what it does correctly. I was not part of the tech development team, so this is just my observation... it's doing things a little different than I thought it would, and kinda nicer... it did NOT just log us out and make us log back in. ALL the computers and devices I had previously used to access the forums where I had the device remember that I was signed in, let me back in, for lack of a better term, ""under the old system"". I could read, post, reply without having to sign in, just like always. I didn't expect that, again for lack of a better term, ""phase out"". It DID make me have to think about it for a sec until I decided that since I hadn't logged out, I must have to.

On each device and computer, once I logged out and came back to the forums, the new sign in window popup came up and I signed in with my Insider credentials.

Not odd. I experienced EXACTLY the same thing. Once you logout of the ""old"", your next login will be the new.

This is about the DEVICES more than the system. I assume that at some point, the system is going to stop recognizing ""remembered"" credentials and take you to the new sign in. But no need to wonder why, just sign out sign in... you've already done it twice

Mileage is worth very little as it relates to trade in value. Our 2013 Passat had 11000 miles after 3 years, got us at most $1000 (10%) extra over a car with average miles. It is worth something, but, in the big scheme of things not much. Makes it more worth it to buy it back at the end of the lease.

Has it had an oil change?
Nope.  89 days until what the service monitor system displays as the first A Service.  I checked with the service manager and he said at the 1-year old date which is in sync with the service reminder.  He further said that with so few miles on the car, the factory oil (Mobil 1 synthetic) is guaranteed for up to 24 months, but Mercedes wants an oil and filter change at 1 year or 10,000 miles, which ever comes first.

The A Service (10,000, 30,000, 50,000 miles or every other year) is more than oil and filter change.  It also includes some HVAC filter changes, brake inspection, top off all fluid levels, at an approximate cost of $400.  It takes about 2 hours to complete.  I belong to the Mercedes Benz Club of America so I get a 15% discount on all parts and labor.

The B Service is the expensive one - about $800 and is performed at 20,000, 40,000, 60,000 miles, etc.  That is an all day affair.

MB vehicles are by no means inexpensive to maintain.

Between higher gas prices, higher food prices, etc.  I suspect inflation is increasing even with the rise in interest rates.  I wonder if we’ll see higher prices on imported new cars and SUV’s.  Much is dependent on the price of steel and aluminum as well as pending tariffs on imported cars.  Time will tell.

Paying more for drivers with the increase in wages, along with the several years now of tighter controls on how long a driver can drive and the pattern of their driving time has increased the need for more drivers. Drivers aren't getting buy with fudging their books like they used to do so they could drive for 20 hours and get the loads there at more profit for them and their trucking company.

I listen to the night radio show when I wake and can't get back to sleep (700, WLW, ATN). That is a show populated by truck drivers calling in to talk about things. The booming economy is letting more of them get more pay, often by switching companies. That means products at the stores will cost more.

Many drivers have gone to specialty trucking--the box trucks and cargo vans that run dedicated routes every day with a definite time schedule and more pay. And they are home and leaving at the same time most days.

That reminds me of a Candid Camera episode from (I looked it up) June 2000. We have an archived bit of the Report Your Local Gas Prices discussion that started in March of 2000. People were reporting like $1.40-$1.50 for RUG back then. The CC episode took place in northern NJ, and they set up a gas station with the sign reading something like:



People FLEW into the station to fill up, then the attendant would come over and say, ""That'll be $42.50"" and then explain to them that they switched to per quart pricing.

Inflation is killing wages for most Americans. There's more in their paychecks but it costs more to buy everything. So wages right now are on a negative curve.

There is currently no connection between the Insider login and your forums login, so if you aren't seeing things like screen name, etc., that's how it's supposed to be.

ONLY when we flip the switch, which looks like sometime tomorrow, will you notice a change. So, if it doesn't look like it's working right now, that's because there's been no change. It's only on our testing environment at the moment, and a bunch of us have tested and tested, so we feel confident that when the switch is made, it's not going to be painful.

No need to worry about the email confirmation, either. You're already in the database as a confirmed member - the old database. So, if you don't confirm with Insider, it's not going to create a problem. As long as your Insider email address matches the one you use in forums, you should be merged seamlessly.

Not likely - MB has a tendency to inflate the residual values to lower the lease payments.

My Jetta has under 12,000 miles in 2 years of a 3 year lease, and the market value is already under the residual value.

But, nothing wrong with a little hope.

You don't want to change the email you use right now, because that's what's going to let your profile information follow you to the new login system.
I don't understand this. Email addresses change all the time. What happens to a user who has to get a new address? Does their username get locked to the old email address forever, forcing them to use a different name? I registered for an insider account using my current gmail address, and it called me Greg based upon the info I entered. What will happen to ab348 when the switch gets thrown? Does it go away, or does Greg?

When I sign in to Insider, it calls me Bob in that Insider page because of the personal info I entered. The switch to a single registration is going to have those same Insider login credentials also work for signing into the forums, where your current forums screenname/profile is what you will be appearing as, no change at all. you'll be ab348, I'll be PF_Flyer, etc.

If the Insider page is welcoming you with Hi Michael, and Michael is what you put in the info you entered, then you did it right and you're good to go. When the new login system kicks in and you come to the forums, just login with your email and pw (your new one if you had to make a longer one like I did) and that's it.

How To Start Your Own Long Term Blog"
3070,August 7,abacomike,"On the lighter side of life (as opposed to ""insider"" log in problems here on Edmunds), when I completed my walk at the mall this morning, I texted my son to find out if there were any last minute things he wanted me to stock up on for the weekend in terms of snacks, food, drinks, etc. I received a text back from him and his suggestions included:

1. Pick up some Cheese flavored Gold Fish because Troy likes those to snack on.

2. Pick up some bananas because Troy likes to eat them in the morning.

3. Try to get some hot dogs, salami, bread, cheese, etc., because he likes that stuff too.

I texted him back questioning what the heck Cheese Flavored Gold Fish were. He said just look at the Pepperidge Farm display and you'll see them. I said OK. But isn't there something you would like me to get in the way of food or snacks for you - he replied no.

So, I go over the Publix and weave in and out of hexagenerians in the aisles looking for ""Gold Fish"". I see them on the ""2 for 1"" list and pick up two bags. But there is a sign next to them and it says, ""...these are fresh and are not contaminated by salmonella! Holy Cow! I couldn't figure out what the heck that sign meant. So I go online with my iPhone to look up ""Gold Fish - Salmonella"". It states there was a recall of 4 different kinds of Gold Fish from Pepperidge Farm and Ritz snacks and Gold Fish from Nabisco due to salmonella back in early July. I had not read or heard anything about that recall. But, since Publix was selling them again and posted that alert, I figured I was OK.

Next, I go over the cheeses and deli products and pick up Hebrew National Hot Dogs and Salami.

I then went over to produce but the bananas were all pretty yellow (ripe) and would probably be over-ripe by Friday. The guy who handles produce went back and brought out some ""greenish/yellowish"" bananas and told me to leave them out - that they would be perfect for Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Thank heavens for professionals who know what they are doing.

I was about to head toward the check-out registers when this little old lady pokes me on my ""derriere"" (she was kind of short and probably couldn't tap me on my back or shoulder) and asks if I would be kind enough to squeeze the nectarines for her to find out if they were ripe enough to eat today. I said of course and proceeded to pick up one nectarine after another trying to get a few that would ""pucker"". Not one of those nectarines was ripe - they were as hard as rocks. I told the little lady. She then asked if I would be kind enough to pucker some peaches. Not one of the peaches was ripe enough to eat today. When she then asked me to squeeze the iceberg lettuce, I said to her, ""...I've squeezed as much produce this morning as I care to squeeze..."" and pointed her over to the produce manager who helped me with my bananas earlier.

Why do I seem to attract the strangest people? Maybe it's my face - so kind and gentlemanly-looking. I must look like the perfect patsy for hexagenerians.

I then go to the check-out and when the register clerk finished scanning everything, she asked if I was signed up for the $5.00 special for $50.00+ purchases this week. I said I did't know. She said to put my 10 digit phone number into the scanner, which I did, and low and behold, $5.00 off plus another $1.00 for the laundry detergent I bought. I need to buy a powerball jackpot ticket tomorrow.

So that was the long and the short of my trip over to the super-market this morning. I don't shop at Walmart any longer because in this high heat and humidity, even though Publix is 20% higher in price, it's only 3 blocks away. Walmart if 4 miles away. By the time I would get home from Walmart, all my frozen dinners and vegetables would we thawed.

You didn't do anything wrong. That search box on the Insider page won't bring you to the forums. You will get there just like you always have, whether you have it in your favorites/bookmarks on your browser or if you just type something like forums.edmunds.com in Google.

And we ARE working on getting the forums to be easier to find from various parts of the site. They've had us sort of hidden for a while, but that should improve as we move ahead.

But HOW the forums look and operate is NOT changing. Just upgrading the login system

ST. ALBANS, Vt. (WCAX) We have new details about a quick stop robbery that sparked a police chase that eventually ended in St. Albans Bay.

It all started Saturday night when police say Stephen Salyer, 38, of Enosburgh, robbed an Enosburgh Maplefields and ran off. Witnesses had spotted an ankle monitor on the robber, so police were able to get a location on Salyer by using surveillance video and the GPS tracking device on his ankle.

Officers say they tried to pull the car over, but they say Salyer took off and led them on a 30-minute chase. Spike strips were used, but that didn't stop the car, which eventually reached St. Albans Bay. Police say Salyer drove out onto the dock and right into Lake Champlain. The vehicle sank to the bottom and investigators say Salyer got out and started to swim away from his vehicle, further into the lake.

Police eventually caught up with him and he was sent to the hospital for his injuries.

Bail was set at $25,000.
He probably got sugared up on those $4 Maplefields muffins and went crazy.

I created an Insider Account using my correct email. I then did some browsing about changes and shown below in BOLD is what I saw when I asked about changing my email here (third question, https://help.edmunds.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011994448-Your-Edmunds-Insider-account):

How do I change the email address or password associated with my Edmunds Insider account? Your email address cannot be updated once you create an account. To change your password, log in to your Insider account and click on the gear icon on your dashboard (or jump directly to your settings using this link).

So, from that it looks like Edmunds expects you to keep your present email and never change it. REALLY EDMUNDS ????

I GET the skepticism. Been through more than a couple of these kind of things along the way, but this one is a bit different. Not a change in forums software or layout or any of the fun things we've had happen over the years, just finally unifying the login system for the site and getting away from the buggy login that can't be bent back into shape anymore.

I don't understand this. Email addresses change all the time. What happens to a user who has to get a new address? Does their username get locked to the old email address forever, forcing them to use a different name? I registered for an insider account using my current gmail address, and it called me Greg based upon the info I entered. What will happen to ab348 when the switch gets thrown? Does it go away, or does Greg?

3107,August 7,PF_Flyer,"Just checked to be sure. Once we switch, users will not be able to change email addys, but as we know, people do change/lose access to email addys now and then. As told to me, we'll have to go through the Insider team as all this data will be their balliwick. Email addresses currently can change, under the new login system, if an email needs to be changed, we'll have to do it on our side of the fence.

Good question. Always appreciate the extra eyeballs and inquisitiveness helping us think of things we might not have thought of

Would also like to know. Do I need an ""insider"" account? Why? 

Insider is going to be the new registration for the whole site. Integrates the whole thing. So someone who shows up and hasn't yet discovered the joys of the forums, won't need to create a new account. I've had an Insider acct for a while and now I'll only have ONE PW to remember (or write down)

There will be no ""outsider"" login, just a single login

3144,August 7,PF_Flyer,"Like it says in the login systems change thread, this will be pretty straightforward.

If you haven't created an Insider account before the change, you'll simply create the account the first time you login after the change. Just be sure to use the same email you login with now so that all your badges follow you

I thought IHOP changed their name.
Yes, they did. They want to try and sell more burgers so have become Ihob.

IHOP's decision to rebrand as IHOb baffled many pancake lovers .

But according to the chain's president, there was a very specific strategy behind the change. And the burger-centric revamp began more than a year before the IHOb brand went viral over the past week.

Last Monday, IHOP — the International House of Pancakes — announced it would change its name to IHOb, flipping the ""P"" to a ""b.""

That's not true. I have these things called eyeballs, two of them, and they work great. I also have superior powers of observation while I""m driving. I'd have noticed an unsafe lane change, not using signals, or cell phone use in many cases, if they had occurred. Expires plates, I'm not paying attention for that, as it doesn't affect my safety. How would the Officer know that from their typical hidden positions? License plate readers? Would they pull someone over for only that reason without being certain their records are not faulty? Seems very far-fetched.

I think we all know all those other reasons are a mere statistical blip on what is usually going on out there.

You may have eyeballs but can you read minds? Unless you can read the officers mind you have no way of knowing why someone got pulled over.

It's called experience. I have this thing called experience. And according to you all my experience getting pulled over is due to speeding.

Don't laugh. Back in the early 70's I was thinking about doing that. Then Mrs. j found out how much that would cost. That was the end of that so I vowed that the next house we built would have one of those or a lift. By the time that happened, when we moved to SC in 1992 and built another house, I didn't want it anymore.

BTW, that guy doesn't look the least bit like Dean Martin, so I'm sure no one in here believes you.

One thing I do wonder about, though, and I've never seen it - when people are building a garage, why can't they depress the floor a bit in the center of a vehicle parking area? Slope it towards the center of the lane to make a shape like a trough like you might if you were putting in a drain. That would allow you to slide under a car for things like oil changes much easier.

Haven't you learned by now if a manufacture wants to weasel out of warranty repair they will find a way to do it and get away with it. Happens all the time. Having a warranty is just something that a manufacture wants you to feel good about having.

As I said, the tire place was a mad house with a ton of attitude. They kept him waiting for hours and wouldn't tell him when they could actually mount the tire back on the car. So he finally gave up and when the tire was on the wheel he took it home to do it himself. That's when he discovered what the AAA guy had pulled.

Here's today's auto adventure.

Last night in a driving rain the ""I don't know nuttin about cars"" kid calls me and says he has a flat. He knows that dad is a sucker for this kind of stuff so I spring into action with the pump and a can of fix a flat. I ask him ""why didn't you change it yourself or call AAA""? He says he knows I like fixing stuff (in other words a sucker) so he graced me with the task. (Inappropriate contented deleted).

I get air in the tire and I notice two big slash marks in the sidewall. How'd that happen I ask....kid hasn't a clue....maybe he gave a Lyft ride to Jack the Ripper. So now he needs a new tire.

I tell him go to the Goodyear store because they can match your original GY tire. I tell him to have AAA put the donut on and he can drop the bad tire at the store. Of course the GY store is a madhouse on Saturday and they treat him like crap with the ""we'll get to it when we get to it"" attitude. He gets the new tire back hours later and tries to mount it on his car.

Turns out the AAA goon he called in the AM torqued the nuts so tight he can't get them off to remount the tire. I come home from the farmer's market and the two off us start hammering and pry barring at them. An hour later we managed to get three of them off but the last two refuse to cooperate. I tell him to call AAA back and get them to fix their mess. The AAA dispatcher screws up the call and we get nothing for two more hours. I tell the kid to call AAA and start yelling. He does and they say an hour wait. 5 minutes later the service truck calls and says he's in the driveway. Huh?

Anyway, takes him 2 seconds with the air gun to bust the last bolts off and the tire gets replaced. Kid loses a day's pay and has to pay another day's pay for the tire.

Moral of the story...don't involve your freaking father in your stupid problems. He gets too upset.

BTW, I told him to file a complaint with AAA about the original service but he's too nice of a guy to try to get anyone in trouble.
Interesting story. I've never seen a AAA service truck with an air gun. I see air compressors on road service trucks for the big 18 wheelers, but not the ones intended for ordinary passenger cars.

If the first AAA service tech did indeed overtighten the lug nuts to that extreme, then I would want to have the brake rotor checked, make sure it didn't get warped.

I think air gun was a misnomer. I was there for the second call and that guy used a portable impact driver to take them off. Sounded just like the air gun at the garage.

So now we have to worry that his brakes are screwed up too? Yikes! As it is I've concluded with the size of the slash, the damage had to have been done while the car was parked at my house. That means someone may have come in at night to deliberately cause damage. I of course am now wondering if it was one of the characters who entered my house last week seeking revenge for calling the police. I really hope it's just my paranoia acting up.

I went in to have a blood test on July 18th to determine if there is any Hep C virus in my blood.  This was going to be the final test in order to consider me cured of Hep C since the 2 previous test detected no virus.

I waited 2 weeks for results.  My doctor got the results last Friday - “unable to complete test for Hep C”!  My doctor called the lab only to find out they mishandled the blood or lost the specimen!  

Anger and ire cannot adequately describe my outrage.  This test was critical in determining if the virus had been eliminated or if it was active.  Now, I have to go to the lab again this Thursday to have them stick me another 4-5 times until they find a vein (I am a hard “stick).  Then I have to wait another 10-14 days to get results.

LabCorp accepted responsibility but what good is that going to do me?  They said there would be no charge for the retest.  Well thank you LabCorp!  Awful!
As bad as that is it's probably better than if they had screwed up and given you a false positive. It's scarey how these lab companies mess up lab results when people's lives depend on them. I remember a 60 Minutes story some years ago where min. wage lab techs were so overworked that they had a high percentage of incorrect results which caused some people to undergo major surgery unnecessarily.

Interesting story. I've never seen a AAA service truck with an air gun. I see air compressors on road service trucks for the big 18 wheelers, but not the ones intended for ordinary passenger cars.

If the first AAA service tech did indeed overtighten the lug nuts to that extreme, then I would want to have the brake rotor checked, make sure it didn't get warped.
I don't want to get into an argument about this but I seriously doubt that over tightened lug nuts will warp a rotor. IMO, the rotor studs would shear off long before the rotor is damaged. However, I'd be much more concerned that when over torqueing is done that the studs will have been stretched beyond their elasticity limit for that given material. One of the best ways to do this is to take the over torqued studs to a materials lab and have them X-rayed to check the grain structure of the over torqued stud and compare it to that of a new stud. Material labs do this all day long and are very good at it but it takes time and money to run the battery of tests required for accurate testing. This being the case, if a car owner is that concerned about over torqueing ruining the studs, the best thing to do is replace the over torqued studs. In fact, I even know someone that did just that because even with his 3/4 inch pneumatic wrench he could not get a few lug nuts loose. If I had to guess, I'd say that around 50% of the cars on the road today have some lug nuts over torqued to some degree beyond the recommended torque specs for their car and the owners have no idea about this because they never touch their lug nuts themselves. It's comforting to know that designers have chosen studs with enough margin to allow for bad installations, otherwise we would hear about this many, many times every day.

FWIW, and once again it is very coincidental since we are on this subject, I read in the Click and clack article this morning in the Sunday paper about a 1972 VW Van that had over torqued lugs nuts. When the owner ""heard a loud clunking on the front passenger side"", she pulled over. When the hub cap was removed she saw ""one lonely lug nut in place the rest had sheared off"". If anyone thinks over torqued lug nuts is a very rare occurrence, I feel sorry for them.

As you say it is an assumption, you really have no idea why that person was pulled over. Maybe due to making unsafe lane changes, or not using signals, or on a cell phone, or expired plates, or having ketchup on your hotdog (illegal here in Chicago), or any other reason. 
That's not true. I have these things called eyeballs, two of them, and they work great. I also have superior powers of observation while I""m driving. I'd have noticed an unsafe lane change, not using signals, or cell phone use in many cases, if they had occurred. Expires plates, I'm not paying attention for that, as it doesn't affect my safety. How would the Officer know that from their typical hidden positions? License plate readers? Would they pull someone over for only that reason without being certain their records are not faulty? Seems very far-fetched.

I think we all know all those other reasons are a mere statistical blip on what is usually going on out there.

You may have eyeballs but can you read minds? Unless you can read the officers mind you have no way of knowing why someone got pulled over.

It's called experience. I have this thing called experience. And according to you all my experience getting pulled over is due to speeding.

Very few people can match the number of tickets I received in my misspent youth. Mostly speeding tickets asn, you know what? I deserved every one that was given to me. Once I failed to yield to a pedestrian that I didn't deserve. I went to court on every ticket I received. I was always the victim. The cop must have clocked the wrong car, etc. The pedestrian was a Wino who had waved me through the crosswalk. (True but I lost this one).

I think during that time I may have ""beat"" one or two of them through my willingness and ability to dispense a believable amount of BS that the judge gave me the benefit of the doubt. A couple of times, the cop didn't show up in court which in CA in those days gave me a free ride!

But, I was 18 years old with a fast car and a cocky attitude.

But, as I said, with one exception....I DESERVED EACH AND EVERY ONE!

The last tiem I got a ticket was when I was 28 years old in my tool truck when I made a left turn at a time I shouldn't have. That was a few years ago.

Since then, I have slowed down. I have quit making excuses and I have dropped (most) of my cockiness.

See Andres, how easy it can be?

In CA in the old days if you smarted off to a cop or acted like you knew more about the law then he did, the cop would draw a very small circle it the upper left of the ticket. He would make a small dot in the middle.

That told the judge that you had been a ""difficult customer""

I never got a circle!
I doubt I've earned more than one circle in all my days on this Earth. That was from the irate Santee Sheriff that batted 1 for 2 in court against me.

It'll only took one cop telling me ""tell it to the judge!"" to hold all roadside arguments for the judge. I haven't argued a case roadside ever since, and that was in my teen years!

I remain as respectful and professional as possible, with the utmost integrity. Since my very first experience in Court as a teen showed me that the Courts lacked integrity, I've been going back over and over waiting for the day they might show some. The County Seat in San Diego has shown me some integrity in the past. They have granted my rightful and legal motions, the same exact motions that other courts have wrongfully denied, and more!

As I've said, maximum speed ticket violations are difficult to argue, and the CHP almost always shows up. I've never had a very strong argument for any of those violations. Basic speed law is different, and as I've pointed out, many of my biggest grievances come from ""off the wall"" vehicle code violations pulled out of an Officer's rear-end.

Interesting. And no, no arguments. Your post made me curious, so I went and did a google search, found articles and forum posts defending both sides of this debate. It would appear that a temporary condition of over-tightening probably did not warp the rotor. Not tightening in the recommended star pattern, or over-tightening one but not all may cause a warped rotor over a period of time. At least that was the conclusion I reached after reading for about 10 minutes.

I know that over-tightening can definitely cause problems for the bolts. I remember watching someone trying to torque the head bolts on an old 6 cylinder Mustang (roughly a 1966 or 1967). This would have been back around 1978 or 79. He applied anti-seize compound to the threads before installing and then tried to torque with a torque wrench. I told him the torque specs were for ""dry"" conditions, but he didn't listen. You can probably guess the results.

If it was important enough for them to waste your time to stop you and write you a citation, it should be important enough to show up in court, and follow all the rules, laws, and procedures properly to win a conviction. If the State has to trample on several laws and rights in order to win convictions, something is wrong. I don't have much of a problem with losing, but the playing field should appear to be fair and level. It does not appear that way.

The ""clerical"" errors that appear to be routine appear to me to not be ""errors"" at all, but designed to be subtle trampling of rights. Why are they so afraid of a fair trial? They will bend and/or break their own rules to avoid it. My letter telling them they were wrong in denying a Trial De Novo based on the 20-day time rule was a perfect example.

My current open case where they wanted to ignore the citation and hold an appearance at a random court of THEIR choosing without giving me reasonable notification or communication and response, is another great example. Why are they so afraid of going by the book?

Also, the fine revenue is more than a drop in the bucket. Remember, the fine isn't the only part of the citation. In CA, you pay more in fees and penalties than the original fine. They do this to avoid challenges to another right, and that is Cruel and Unusual Punishment. By not calling it a ""fine"" apparently the State thinks it's not a punishment.

Remember that I also have the right to wave those rights. And I Have the right to say, yep you got me and is a fair charge and take my lumps like an adult.

Last night in a driving rain the ""I don't know nuttin about cars"" kid calls me and says he has a flat.

He says he knows I like fixing stuff (in other words a sucker) so he graced me with the task. (Inappropriate contented deleted).

I get air in the tire and I notice two big slash marks in the sidewall. How'd that happen I ask....kid hasn't a clue....maybe he gave a Lyft ride to Jack the Ripper. So now he needs a new tire.

I tell him go to the Goodyear store because they can match your original GY tire. I tell him to have AAA put the donut on and he can drop the bad tire at the store. Of course the GY store is a madhouse on Saturday and they treat him like crap with the ""we'll get to it when we get to it"" attitude. He gets the new tire back hours later and tries to mount it on his car.

Turns out the AAA goon he called in the AM torqued the nuts so tight he can't get them off to remount the tire. I come home from the farmer's market and the two off us start hammering and pry barring at them. An hour later we managed to get three of them off but the last two refuse to cooperate. I tell him to call AAA back and get them to fix their mess. The AAA dispatcher screws up the call and we get nothing for two more hours. I tell the kid to call AAA and start yelling. He does and they say an hour wait. 5 minutes later the service truck calls and says he's in the driveway. Huh?

Anyway, takes him 2 seconds with the air gun to bust the last bolts off and the tire gets replaced. Kid loses a day's pay and has to pay another day's pay for the tire.

Moral of the story...don't involve your freaking father in your stupid problems. He gets too upset.

BTW, I told him to file a complaint with AAA about the original service but he's too nice of a guy to try to get anyone in trouble.

I come home from the farmer's market and the two off us start hammering and pry barring at them. An hour later we managed to get three of them off but the last two refuse to cooperate. I tell him to call AAA back and get them to fix their mess. The AAA dispatcher screws up the call and we get nothing for two more hours. I tell the kid to call AAA and start yelling. He does and they say an hour wait. 5 minutes later the service truck calls and says he's in the driveway. Huh?

Anyway, takes him 2 seconds with the air gun to bust the last bolts off and the tire gets replaced. Kid loses a day's pay and has to pay another day's pay for the tire.

Moral of the story...don't involve your freaking father in your stupid problems. He gets too upset.

BTW, I told him to file a complaint with AAA about the original service but he's too nice of a guy to try to get anyone in trouble.
I'd say something about letting other people touch your wheels but you guys have heard it several times already.

I did like the styling on the Hawks and the Conestoga wagons (motorized that is), but I grew up in the Chicago suburbs which were kind of between South Bend (Studebaker) and Kenosha (Rambler, aka Kenosha Kadilacs). The interesting thing to me back then was that Chicago was a big GM town, but it was Ford that had a auto plant there and Chrysler had one out toward Rockford, maybe 60 or so miles away. Well, maybe too much familiarity..."

As for telling a Caddie owner that burning that much oil ""was normal"", I'd say that too if I sold oil and/or wanted to renege on warranty service.

3323,August 5,Michaell,"Warning, long post ahead … skip if you're not interested in my experience at the BMW driving event today

Today I attended, for the first time, a BMW Driving Event, sponsored by the local dealer. It was a two hour session, split equally between a ""long course"" and a ""short course"".

The facility is actually owned by the county, and is primarily used by law enforcement for high speed training and car control.

The ""long course"" is about a mile in length, and simulates a standard 2 lane road with a double yellow line. A few low speed corners and a decently long straight stretch, interrupted by a slalom with 6-7 gates. Decent elevation changes, too (the video I linked to earlier is the facility). This is in no way a race track - there are no run off areas.

The ""short course"" is set up for autocross; lots of low speed corners and one short straight stretch.

The local SCCA was out to monitor and time the autocross portion.

We split into two groups, and I went onto the long course first. We had a pace car - 2001 Z3M, driven by one of the SCCA hot shoes. First lap was orientation, 2nd and 3rd laps were at speed. Due to some scheduling delays, our group was only able to do 3 sets of laps. Fortunately, I was able to drive one of them - in an X3 M40i.

Way more fun than I expected - I was able to break 80 MPH on the straight stretch, before the slalom. I was complimented by one of my passengers that I was using an appropriate racing line (there were no professional drivers accompanying us). Unfortunately, the doofus who had the M4 three cars in front of me didn't seem to understand the concept of what the right pedal was for, so I wasn't able to really exercise the car.

I rode shotgun in both the X3 as well as in an X5 50i. The X5, my friends, is a seriously fast SUV. Except the driver nailed one of the slalom cones on the last lap. And, the M550i in front of us was going way faster.

On to the short course. There were 4 vehicles available - the M4 (after the first laps on the long course, the event organizers swapped it and another car out for two others), a 440i 6-speed, an X2 and a 650i GC. I drove the X2 twice, and the 440i and 650i GC once each.

I saw two times for my laps - 46.1 in the X2 and 45.9 in the 650. I kept the 440i in 2nd gear the whole lap, but didn't see a time.

I was pretty impressed with the X2; I pushed it to the limit the second time around and was able to induce a short 4-wheel drift on one of the tighter turns. Startled me into lifting off the throttle for a moment.

The 650 was surprisingly agile, as well, for something so big.

I have a new found appreciation for the ""Ultimate Driving Machine"" tag line, and I also learned that I'm a lousy passenger when cars are being driven in anger.

Wish I had the opportunity to do another half dozen laps, in the same car. I was starting to learn the course and figure there was time to shave.

All in all, a pretty fun day, even though a bunch of ""bros"" tried jumping the queue for extra seat time in the M4 and 440i.

I was prepared to not like the X2, from a driving point of view. I've seen a few on the roads and think they are pretty handsome. Time behind the wheel convinced me that it's got good driving dynamics, as well.

I'm still likely in the market for a sedan as my next DD, however.

A lot of the younger folks in attendance were more interested in drifting the cars than doing a fast time on the short course. Which was interesting, since I think everything but the M4 was xDrive. Could still see the RWD bias, however.

3328,August 4,andres3,"Here's my only winning trial by declaration/mail of all-time:

Attachment #1A

STATEMENT OF FACTS:

Pursuant to vehicle code 40902, I wish to exercise my right to trial by declaration with regard to a vehicle code infraction citation. As required, I enclose a check for $148.00 bail. Please refund the same to me in the event the court finds me not guilty.

On January 26, 2006, at approximately 3:50 p.m., I was driving my 2003 Honda Accord LX Coupe, License No. 4ZXM826, south on 805 coming from Highway 56. My vehicle is dark gray in color (graphite). Please review attachment #1B, which contains a series of photographs along with a written description of what each photograph clearly demonstrates.

I have two main points of defense as follows:

1. Cited for vehicle code 21755VC violation, which never occurred according to the vehicle code’s very own definition, as I never “passed on shoulder.”
2. I never drove (and definitely didn’t pass anyone) on a shoulder, because the concrete lane I was in was an actual freeway lane and exit lane or off ramp.

First, the title of VC21755 is “pass on right safely,” or passing on shoulder as the officer wrote on my citation copy as the violation that allegedly occurred. This vehicle code does not apply to my case or to the situation that happened on 1/26/06. I never passed anyone on the right, I never passed anyone driving on the shoulder, and I never passed any vehicles on the freeway, period. I was planning on exiting the freeway at the next off ramp. I was already slowing down, as is the normal process in order to exit the freeway. You cannot pass people on the freeway when you are in the process of exiting the freeway, it just doesn’t make logical sense (you are headed different directions for one). Add to this that I had slowed down considerably, and you can know it is a fact that freeway traffic was moving faster than I was. The only vehicle I passed was the officer’s parked CHP car, and I passed it on the left as I merged carefully back onto the next lane over on the left in order to avoid a collision. I have a second attachment 1C that shows the address I was driving to and from where I came, which was 5951 Village Center Loop Road, right off of highway 56. I took the 805 South and was headed towards 9823 Pacific Heights Blvd., therefore, the map indicated to me that I was to exit the 805 South at Mira Mesa Blvd/Sorrento Valley Road, which is the first thing I told the officer who was blocking the right lane with his vehicle (although he was not inside his vehicle). The fact of the matter is that I never passed anyone on the right, I had slowed down significantly, and I had every intention of exiting the freeway.

Secondly, I, along with every other reasonable driver, both in front and behind of me, felt that the right lane was indeed a lane, and not a shoulder based on the overwhelming visual evidence on the freeway. Any reasonable person would view the asphalt lane as the shoulder, the concrete lane as the far right lane, and that lane eventually becoming the exit only lane. Most drivers probably assumed the solid white line was there to indicate that it is an “exit only” lane, and that you should not re-merge back onto the freeway.

I would like your honor to know that I included every single rearview photograph taken within 5 minutes of receiving my citation. I did not take 40 or 50 photos and edit the best 3 or 4 rearview pictures for my defense. I included each and every single rear-facing picture I took, because I wanted to make it clear that without intending it, every single picture happened to capture another vehicle coming down the exact same lane the officer cited me for driving on, which he claims was a shoulder. There were no lane closure signs; even a semi-truck came down the exact same lane the officer claimed was a shoulder. Also, the lane in question goes straight into and directly onto the right most exit lane. There is no need to turn or change lanes; it simply is the same lane. I find it unreasonable to assume that all of these driver’s could have misinterpreted the freeway lanes. The officer incorrectly assumed it was a shoulder, and double-parked his vehicle alongside the white truck.

Therefore, in conclusion, I should be found not guilty due to the fact that I never placed my vehicle onto a shoulder, and I never passed any vehicles on the freeway, regardless of whether the lane I was in would be considered a shoulder or not. I was on a main traveled portion of the roadway (as indicated by all the traffic using that lane of the roadway in my pictures. Lastly, even if I did pass vehicles to my left (passing on right, which I state I didn’t), I did so in a safe manner and under conditions permitting such movement in safety. I believe I did nothing illegal, as my physical actions were no different than if someone had decided to pull over to change a flat tire, then changed their minds, and safely pulled back onto the freeway so that they could change their flat tire elsewhere.

I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California that the foregoing is true and correct.

Superior Court of California, County of San Diego
Kearny Mesa Branch – Traffic/Minor Offense
8950 Clairemont Mesa Blvd.
San Diego, CA 92123-1187

To: Presiding Judge for Traffic Court

Re: Citation/Case Number 1471662 – Defendant: JOE COOL

I am writing the court today to have what I believe to have been a clerical error on the part of the Court in denying my Request for a Trial De Novo recently in case number 1471662.

Background Facts:

The clerk signed the certificate of mailing form TR-215 (Decision and Notice of Decision) as dated December, 31, 2013 on the case referenced above. The decision was postmarked January 2, 2014, most likely due to the Holiday at the New Year.

On January 17, 2014 the Defendant, Andres Dolson, completed a Request for a New Trial (Trial De Novo Form TR-220), and then proceeded to hand deliver the completed form to the Kearny Mesa Branch court on that same date at approximately 1:30 P.M. The defendant placed the form into an envelope provided at the outdoor drop-box by the front entrance doors to the court facility. The envelope was filled out by hand and I placed the date and time of the drop-off onto the envelope. If the court keeps the envelope on file, the court can confirm that I hand time-stamped the delivery at approximately 1:30 p.m. on 1/17/14 to the Request for a Trial De Novo. No electronic automatic stamp is provided at the court's outdoor drop-box.

On Friday, 17 January, the Court's business office has reduced hours, which is why I had fully and completely relied upon the court's outside exterior signage to follow directions and hand-in my request for a Trial De Novo in a timely fashion to meet all of the court's requirements by delivering the request well within the 20 days required from the clerk's certificate of mailing on the Trial By Declaration Decision. After depositing my delivery in the exterior drop-box outdoors, I noticed that although the business offices were closed due to reduced hours on Fridays, the court was still open for other matters such as Small Claims, and that the front doors were still open. It was then I noticed there was an indoor interior drop-box with an automatic electronic time stamp. Since I didn't have another copy of my TR-220 form, I time-stamped my court courtesy notice for this case/citation number to provide some proof that I was at the court on January 17, 2014 (see attachment “A” which is a 2 page copy of my time-stamped courtesy notice at January, 17, 2014 1:41 PM and 1:42 PM), taken just in case an unexpected adverse decision such as that provided on 1/23/14 was made by the court. I had no other business to drive over to the Kearny Mesa Branch, and be at the court on January 17 at approximately 1:41-1:42 PM other than to personally deliver my Request for a Trial De Novo Form TR-220 on the case number referenced above.




It should be noted that the outdoor drop-box has no such automatic time-stamp provided. However, I fully complied with the directions on the outdoor drop-boxes signage, which promises that if an item is deposited by 4:00 PM it will be considered as received by the court on that same business court date (see attachment “B” two photographs taken by me on 1/28/14 of the outdoor signage on the exterior drop-box in question). The directions on the signage are very clear, and based upon that it is certain that my delivery of the Request for a Trial De Novo should have been logged as received on January 17, 2014 by the court.

By my count 20 days after the Certificate of Mailing dated 12/31/13 would be 1/20/14, which was a Court Holiday. Even if the court logged my TR-220 submission as received on 1/21/14, it is my understanding that the request should have been granted as received on time due to that Holiday. I believe this is a possible cause of the error, since on 1/28/14 when I visited the court again to take photographs of the instructional signage on the court's drop-boxes, I noticed that there is a discrepancy as the interior drop-box has slightly different instruction than the exterior signage. The interior signage says if a submission is not time-stamped, that it will be logged as received on the following business/court date. The exterior drop box makes no mention of this as it specifically states same date regardless of whether it's stamped or not, nor does it make any exception or notation for shortened hours on Fridays. Form TR-220 also makes no mention of reduction to the 20 day time line due to potentially shortened hours on some court dates such as Fridays. The outdoor signage simply states that if an item is deposited by 4:00 PM on any court day Monday through Friday (which 17 January was in fact an active court date), then it will be logged as received on that same date. Therefore, since I relied upon and used only the exterior drop-box, the signage on that box is the one that should apply and take precedence in regards to this case.

Based on the above facts, the court should not have denied my Request for a New Trial (Trial De Novo) for the check marked reason of not having been received on time. Although the time-stamped courtesy notice is not definitive irrefutable proof the court received my Request for a Trial De Novo on 1/17/14, it is indeed powerful circumstantial evidence corroborating my story. I'm confident the request was received by the court 17 days after the court clerk's certificate of mailing. Please change the decision entered on the Form TR-225 dated 1/23/14, and grant my request for a new fair trial with the officer present so that I may face my accuser in a court of law. Also, please schedule my trial date and time.

Thank you, and Sincerely,



Joe Cool

As you say it is an assumption, you really have no idea why that person was pulled over. Maybe due to making unsafe lane changes, or not using signals, or on a cell phone, or expired plates, or having ketchup on your hotdog (illegal here in Chicago), or any other reason.

I do have experience with traffic courts, but none recently. In my younger days I have had plenty.

As for paying fines regardless of whether I am guilty or not is outright wrong. I can honestly say that for all the times I was pulled over I was guilty of the offense that the officer pulled me over for with the exception on one time. That one time the officer was mistaken about my plates being expired and as he came to my window stated that he thought my plates were expired but saw the sticker clearer after I pulled over and saw that they were not. He let me go immediately without checking my license (which legally he couldn't do anyway). 

But every other time I was in the wrong, I knew I was in the wrong and I did make the decision to be in the wrong. Now if some cases I did not agree with the law, but that really is no excuse. So in these cases I owed up to what I did and took responsibility for my actions. I didnt try to justify my actions and play the victim.

And yes when you cost out the salary of the officer, those that support him or her, the salary of the judge and the clerk of the court and any bailiffs and all that support them in their traffic law enforcement pulse all the equipment and building space and all that supports that. pluse any benefits paid the fines usually don't add up to any amount that covers it.

Most people do just pay; they count on that. Most States know not to be greedy, and keep fines low. CA is greedy; more people are fighting them. The courts are clogged with people fighting their tickets. Did I mention my next trial is in November; that was scheduled a while back too.

The problem is you don't have any experience with traffic courts.

Even when your guilty, you still have a right to have the ""People"" prove their case beyond a resonable doubt.

There's also the 5th Amendment where you don't have to incriminate yourself. I see nothing wrong with forcing the State to do their job, and that is prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt with the Officer present. That goes to facing your accuser.

If it was important enough for them to waste your time to stop you and write you a citation, it should be important enough to show up in court, and follow all the rules, laws, and procedures properly to win a conviction. If the State has to trample on several laws and rights in order to win convictions, something is wrong. I don't have much of a problem with losing, but the playing field should appear to be fair and level. It does not appear that way.

The ""clerical"" errors that appear to be routine appear to me to not be ""errors"" at all, but designed to be subtle trampling of rights. Why are they so afraid of a fair trial? They will bend and/or break their own rules to avoid it. My letter telling them they were wrong in denying a Trial De Novo based on the 20-day time rule was a perfect example.

My current open case where they wanted to ignore the citation and hold an appearance at a random court of THEIR choosing without giving me reasonable notification or communication and response, is another great example. Why are they so afraid of going by the book?

Also, the fine revenue is more than a drop in the bucket. Remember, the fine isn't the only part of the citation. In CA, you pay more in fees and penalties than the original fine. They do this to avoid challenges to another right, and that is Cruel and Unusual Punishment. By not calling it a ""fine"" apparently the State thinks it's not a punishment.

It's a pretty soild assumption when you see it happen in front/alongside/behind you. You are observing traffic, and you don't see any violations yourself, other than speeding, which everyone is doing, so when someone gets pulled over, pretty safe process of elmination. Also, if the fastest guy that just passed you gets pulled over, another prettty strong indicator.

As you say it is an assumption, you really have no idea why that person was pulled over. Maybe due to making unsafe lane changes, or not using signals, or on a cell phone, or expired plates, or having ketchup on your hotdog (illegal here in Chicago), or any other reason. 

That's not true. I have these things called eyeballs, two of them, and they work great. I also have superior powers of observation while I""m driving. I'd have noticed an unsafe lane change, not using signals, or cell phone use in many cases, if they had occurred. Expires plates, I'm not paying attention for that, as it doesn't affect my safety. How would the Officer know that from their typical hidden positions? License plate readers? Would they pull someone over for only that reason without being certain their records are not faulty? Seems very far-fetched.

I think we all know all those other reasons are a mere statistical blip on what is usually going on out there.

5. Attempts to stop the process are unrealistic, futile and frankly stupid. They are politically motivated by busy body types who will latch to any opportunity to take control over other peoples' lives,cause it's what they live for. Corporations, initially resisting the legislation, joined it on the premise of extra business for themselves. Infamous now are those CFL bulbs with highly toxic filaments, that didn't fix anything, but were shoved down peoples' throats, just to be supplanted by LED bulbs (the issue is much more complex). Another such glaring example is dieselgate by VW - classic attempt to ""save the planet"" by giving everybody cancer through nitrogen oxides. The electric/hybrid vehicles are not ""saints"" either - we will yet to see devastation caused by lithium extraction or storage of highly toxic spent batteries in the future.
6. All of that sums up to conclusion we know something, we don't know whole lot more and political decisions based on this information have potential to do more harm than good. People who are in charge and try to peddle some of ""solutions"" are not trustworthy, their motivation is less than pure..
I dealt with serious data for a time as part of the work to which I was assigned. We did not have to fudge data, ignore data parts, to make any conclusions from that data. We didn't handpick or modify data records, nor did we select certain periods of time, as was/is done with the global warming hopeful.

The idea of global warming as a cause for certain folks to tax or sell is transparently a political purpose. Certain people have made millions maybe even billions already. We seldom have seen so many experts in the media with degrees in nothing, especially not in sciences which study and track the earth, as have been held up by the media. People with broadcasting school certificates as meteorologists are experts in the whom earth's behavior.

I parallel it (trigger alert) to the way many people stereotype GM products automatically (based on some deserved reputations in some models in the past).

I am surprised someone wanted to bring up this touchy topic. But the media makes it work with the populist method of putting out information for the people to believe that is being used these days. I believe more important is the 11-year sunspot cycle and a volcano erupting to warming and cooling.

Some data says the earth has been slowly cooling for a few years overall. There will be hot spots setting records every day. There will be cold spots setting records every day. There will be Lynchburgs with flooding potential due to heavy rainfall setting records every day. There is always an extreme being set somewhere, somehow. Macht nichts.

Also, IMO the EPA stuff (car emissions, coal burning, etc) issue got hijacked into global warming. That really generated from a much more basic problem of pollution at the ground level. Which really is a lot more relevant to people right now. Look at China, India, etc. That is a people issue (burning lots of crap polluting the environment and fouling air/water). Even if it does not materially change the climate long term, cleaning that stuff up will save lives (and parts of the planet).

Dino, you touch on a common theme. People like things the way they are, and don't want change. Ignoring that before them, things were different. So they don't care if 200 years ago a coastline was 1 mile further out to sea. They just don't want it to move inland 1 inch in their lifetime. When in reality, land has always been evolving, so if low lying coastal areas are going to flood, move elsewhere instead of trying to stop the ocean from doing what oceans do!

Nope not trolling you. Just trying to look at this without all the hype and fear mongering that goes along with it. The fact of the matter is is that ever since the earth formed the climate has been in a constant state of flux. Sometimes changing faster sometimes slower but always changing. There are various reasons for the changes but it is a consistent change. To look at climate change as if the climate is static and any change is of human origin is disingenuous. We need to understand that climate change is a natural occurrence and how much is due to human activity and how and if we should act on it.

As much as I travel, I spend a lot of time in the airport Brookstones. Trying to remember, but I think I ended up buying a piece of carryon rollaboard luggage there to replace one that had just busted its wheels and handle. That was probably about 3 years ago and I still use their luggage. Matter of fact, I quite like it.

Sometimes I would stop in for a connector that I either lost or broke. I think I have one of their airline pillows.

That’s about it.

Not surprising they’re going out of business. With the amount of stores, expecially in airports, that sell the same stuff they did, they long gave up the category they had almost entirely to themselves.

For awhile there, they even were the only place to buy Temperpedic mastresses (now those matresses can be bought everywhere). And, the massage chairs can be had elsewhere, too. Just saw a display for those at Costco.

3393,August 3,abacomike,"It is unfortunate that The EPA is no longer going to continue to require fuel economy and emission mandates for vehicles after 2020 - in other words, leave those mandates at the 2020 levels.

I have become convinced that increased levels of CO2 and other pollutants in our atmosphere have contributed to worldwide changes in climate.  Pollution of the oceans has also affected the populations of fish and other living organisms.  I am also aware that climate change is cyclical over long periods of time.

My point is this:

We know that air and water pollution negatively affect animal, plant, sealife and human life - to a greater or lesser degree - still to be determined.  So why not at least “continue” to reduce carbon emissions and pollution of our planet that are controllable?  In Beijing, they wear face masks because the air pollution is so intense.  India is also a major contributor to pollution.

Why take the chance that the earth is merely going through a cyclical weather change?  I am not an “Al Gore” supporter but we need to take care of this planet if we want this planet to take care of us!

Actually they are just rolling back Obama's mandates, the 2020 mandates are still in effect. Seriously auto emissions are so clean compared to the past that Obama's mandates wouldnt do much. Plus every increase in mileage and or emissions comes at an even greater cost than the previous. There is only so much power in a gallon of gas and only so clean it will burn. Obama's mandates would have been hard to achieve and would have increased car prices.

As for global warming this will have little if any affect. Climate change is a natural occurrence and in the past it has been hotter than it is now and in the future it will be cooler than it is now. And yes there is plenty of evidence that that natural climate change ca occurs rapidly. As for how much is man made is open for debate.

Yes, I lean towards BMWs, but I think it's ludicrous to offer two levels of ""Performance"" Packages when at the end of the day neither one allows the Mustang to be tracked for more than a few laps. That's not the case with SRT vehicles or the Camaro SS 1LE(which by the way, costs about the same as a GT PP2)
I like the Mustang, and in fact almost bought a CPO 2015 GT Premium, but I balk at paying $6,500 for a so-called ""Level 2"" performance upgrade only to be told I need to spend another few thousand dollars before it is track capable.
None of the other cars I considered before buying my 2er had a similar handicap to the GT- WRX STi, Golf R, SS 1LE, Challenger SRT, Cayman- all were track capable out of the box.

I won't say that personal transport is a significant factor in climate change, but if US standards dumb down products, it will likely make those products less competitive in other markets (of course, there are still people out there who think consumers in Sapporo or Stuttgart want products designed for the USDM and that the only things holding them back are small tariffs) - and isn't industry supposed to be a new focus? We'll see. Seems like more trolling of greenies/CA people to distract from other more serious malfeasance.

Samsung was one I saw a couple months back that was new. 1080. 32inch. Smart. 5300 model. Price just dropped and my wife says the Sony is cutting out more frequently.

The Samsung does NOT have auto timer ON ability. The 40-inch Samsung in the family room has 3 preset times. The Sony had a single time on setting that was easily reset as an alarm clock when needed.

Now I've got to shop models again. Many are 720. Samsung supposedly has a straight forward Smart ability that's easy to use. I intended to switch to internet TV using Spectrum internet possibly... My DSL is probably too slow.

I never would have thunk to look for alarm clock capabilities when in the showroom. I would think Samsung would include that if it's in other software chips.

I think the ""denial"" reaction comes from highly suspicious and political way it was all introduced. The first documents were full of materially incorrect statements that seem to all be going ""one way"". Then data that could introduce any doubt was systematically scrubbed from subsequent documents (e.g. Medieval warming period). I'm in the skeptic camp myself, but not a complete denier. This is my position:

1. I don't doubt the climate is changing faster than before. It's always been changing, but now it may be changing faster than before.
2. It is likely that human contribution is a significant factor, but I'm not completely convinced human contribution is decisive factor.
3. The ""Earth is dying"" thesis, or similar catastrophic visions are complete BS, IMHO. Things will change, for many to worse, but we are not going to go extinct, or some garbage like that.
4. For humans, it's more of economic factor, not existential. We should debate how to adapt, not how to stop it. We should look at opportunities (northern climate agriculture, northern passage for shipping) as much as threats (sea water rise displacing large number of people). We should develop technologies coping with some effects (e.g. make desalination cheaper and more practical).
5. Attempts to stop the process are unrealistic, futile and frankly stupid. They are politically motivated by busy body types who will latch to any opportunity to take control over other peoples' lives,cause it's what they live for. Corporations, initially resisting the legislation, joined it on the premise of extra business for themselves. Infamous now are those CFL bulbs with highly toxic filaments, that didn't fix anything, but were shoved down peoples' throats, just to be supplanted by LED bulbs (the issue is much more complex). Another such glaring example is dieselgate by VW - classic attempt to ""save the planet"" by giving everybody cancer through nitrogen oxides. The electric/hybrid vehicles are not ""saints"" either - we will yet to see devastation caused by lithium extraction or storage of highly toxic spent batteries in the future.
6. All of that sums up to conclusion we know something, we don't know whole lot more and political decisions based on this information have potential to do more harm than good. People who are in charge and try to peddle some of ""solutions"" are not trustworthy, their motivation is less than pure.

Most of us do not have any direct contact with traffic law inforcement activities because we obey or are in compliance with all traffic laws.

One or two posters here try to defend bending or violating some traffic ordinances or laws as they drive and condemn law enforcement for strictly enforcing laws and regulations.  Why?  Because they find the traffic laws too restricting for their driving preferences.  Tough, isn’t it!

Actually cracking down on more than speed might alleviate some stress from those who have to dodge idiots, especially on foot.

On the other hand, this morning I saw a brave hardworking bootstrapper in a Tesla going maybe 60-70 in a 40, probably less likely to be nabbed for that than a 19 year old from a less affluent suburb speeding in a 20 year old Civic. But I guess that's how it goes, justice is not blind, they deserve the endless tax breaks, with more upcoming, as the entitled lucky ones like to lecture ""life isn't fair"", dopey libertarians will cry ""class warfare!"" if anyone questions this dumb status quo

My experience is that the traffic courts tend to be somewhat fair and impartial. But then again I take responsibility for my actions. As for financial missions, most jurisdictions don't make money on traffic enforcement.

I have only one experience in traffic court.

This was when we moved to SC in March of 1992. Immediately after moving there I found a builder and he warned me about driving on Martinstown Rd in North Augusta SC (across the river from Augusta GA) . He had gotten several tickets on this well known to locals speed trap road. I just got off of I20 (55 MPH limit) on my way to see a place about something for the house when I was pulled over for speeding. The cop didn't want to hear my plea that I wasn't speeding so I shut up and decided to fight it in traffic court. That was an experience almost worth getting a ticket for. The magistrate allowed everyone ahead of us to plead their case (had to be at least 8 or 9 people) but in the end his gavel came down and he announced, ""the state of SC finds you guilty of speeding as charged (going xxx miles over the posted speed limit, pay $xxx fine and the number of points to be assessed) to the clerk on your way out"". He said this to EVERYONE, without exception, ahead of us. After hearing this 5 or 6 times I knew I was doomed and at one point Mrs. j leaned over and whispered, ""you know you are going to have the ticket upheld so why bother""? I told her since I was already there I might as well get my swing in.

Finally, it's my turn and I rose and told the magistrate the cop had to have captured the speed of a car that was passing me and I went on to tell him I had my car for about 10 years and had a very good feel for how fast my car was going at just about any speed and it was impossible that I was going 57 MPH in a 40 MPH zone. The magistrate politely listened like he did for all that came ahead of me, then he asked Mrs. j to stand and give her account of what happened. She confirmed what I said about a car passing me. He then asked the cop in the back of the room if he saw a car passing me. The cop said he didn't. The magistrate said, ""you know, I have a car that is about 7 years old and I know what you mean about having a feel for how fast you are going when you've had a car that long"". He scratches his head and asked, ""do you think you could have been going 5 MPH over the speed limit""? I said, ""5 was possible but not..."" that's when he cut me off and slammed his gavel down saying, ""the state of SC finds you guilty of going 45 MPH in a 40 MPH zone. Pay the clerk $45 on your way out and no points will be assessed"". I was stunned, to say the least. I still can't understand how that happened.

When I told my builder what happened he couldn't figure it out either other than to say, ""maybe she (pointing to Mrs. j) should go with me the next time I get a ticket on that road"".

Hah! Yes, that is the truth! The firefighters (again, the rank and file, not the top brass) at my organization are among the highest paid staff. Their ""base salary"" is quite modest, but the actual amount of salary they receive per year is close to double that. Our police are not even in the same wheelhouse. They receive solid compensation, but nothing like the firefighters.

They seem to me to be badly overpaid, and I do acknowledge the risky and sometimes unpleasant nature of the job. But here, our cost of living is pretty low by comparison to larger places, the crime rate is low and mostly non-violent stuff, and by far the biggest chore for the fire service is a protocol that makes them, not police, the first responder to every traffic accident no matter how small. In short most days are filled with mundane tasks. When a fire or police captain (not eligible for OT) makes $120K and a regular firefighter or constable makes $115K, something is broken.

Here the pension is indeed very generous. Eligibility is based on the rule of 80 for non emergency personal and 75 for public safety personal (age + years of service). The annual pension amount is calculated on the average of their best (highest salary) 3 years, and then the pension amount is 2%* # years of service, for life with indexing if the plan is solvent.

3494,August 2,andres3,"The first motion was a change of venue based on CA vehicle code where it was requested at the time of the citation, but was not granted by the officer. In contention (perhaps, as the Officer nor DA showed up to oppose me), was that I most definitely worked closer to the County Seat than the assigned Court. The VC does say you have to live or work closer to ""demand"" the County Seat. I used a business card and my sworn under oath and penalty of perjury testimony that indeed my place of work was closer to the County Seat (geographically wasn't even close, so a map was not needed in my opinion), so it should clearly be granted if we are to follow the law. She said something riduclous to the effect of ""I hadn't established to the court's satisfaction I worked closer to the County Seat."" I was flabbergasted, as I was UNOPPOSED! the People were not represented, other than by this judge that seemed to take on the role of prosecutor instead of judge! This is the SAME EXACT motion granted to my lawyer a few months ago. Only difference there was that the Officer did grant the County Seat, and a Court adminisitrative error placed it in the wrong Court. Their is PUBLISHED case law for the County Seat VC to be adhered to, so my case was highly appealable since I was later found guilty and my rightful motion was improperly and incorrectly denied. That would be solid grounds to overthrow the case. The People's only argument to oppose that would be to argue that the ""error"" didn't prejudice my case substantially (which I know it did, but the Court might not accept or like the reasons why). I should have appealed the decision based on the faulty motion denial, but I didn't. Would have cost some serious time and money. Lawyers don't like to waste thier political capital on stuff like this. They'd probably upset the judge who's ruling got appealed, and they make more money on the sheer numbers of cases they take in traffic court.

Two pretty basic motions that had nothing to do with one another. I had a similar motion to the second one previously granted at the County Seat for another case. These motions come straight out of the NOLO PRESS David Brown books. They are nothing extraordinary.

The judge in Ventura didn't like all the points of my defense, which included mentioning I had a radar detector that indicated to my vehicle wasn't the one that was ""radared."" He also probably didn't like that I made the officer show twice, since on the first trial date they had not responded to my discovery request, in in response to my motion to compel discovery, they suddenly produced the requested items right then and there that day at trial. This is why I now insist on a motion hearing BEFORE trial date.

Anyway, I was given a choice to review the documents right then and there and have my trial a half hour or 2 later (as needed), or a continuance. Since the Officer had showed up, I went with continuance. I think my motion plus a thorough defense and cross examination (since he showed up again!) bothered the judged enough that he let it show. There's no real good defense for 97 MPH, but I brought up every plausible reasonable doubt from tire inflation to radar errors. The detector worked fine for other CHP radar, I have never been given to this date any reason to think it malfunctioned the one time it mattered. I may have been speeding, but I believe his 97 radar reading was spurious error or made-up. He also stated he estimated my speed before activating the radar, which must of been for quite a spectacular range of distance given we were headed in opposite directions. I got him to admit he couldn't tell what brand/model of car I was driving at that distance, but somehow the court believes his speed estimate is accurate anyway? I wasn't any good at the timeline defense back then, but if this happened again, I'd try to get the officer to testify to a timeline of events, and then use speed math to show that the positions of our vehicles throughout the timeline may not line up with his story.

It does surprise me as I cannot remember you posting anything about those citations, just getting busted for speeding. Maybe you could link one of your previous posts talking about one of those ""gotcha"" citations.

Let's see. The last ticket I was convicted for was a ""Stop Sign"" violation. Yes, the intersection near my home where I believe in 1,000 visits to this stop sign, I've never encountered a crossing car that needed to be yieilded to first. Talk about high traffic and high hazard! I probably rolled through at less than 3 MPH, and sight lines are amazing. He wasn't on the ""travel"" portion of roadway, but hidden in a parking spot along the residential street; behind a parked car.

I recall my story of my only ""not guilty"" verdict. Was a trial by declaration too. VC cited for was ""Passing on the Right Shoulder."" I successfully argued either 1) the lane wasn't a shoulder but the right-most lane of travel, and/or 2) even if it was a shoulder, I didn't pass anyone.

He didn't explain if he bought both arguments, but I only needed to convince him of one of those elements, and a not guilty verdict results.

I received my only tailgating ticket ever when I was still in college. That one was funny, as I remember it being possibly the worst ""cut-off"" in my entire life. Unsafe lane change was the correct violation to issue, for the guy in front of me!

I have at least 3 incidences of being ticketed for ""running a red light"" when really what happened was an argument over whether I came to a complete stop for a right turn on red. My first ticket ever at 16 or 17 was for running a red light that was still yellow (I legally had entered that intersection! AT least that one was a left turn).

I was wrongly accused of using the exit lanes as a passing lane on the freeway. In fact, I had just gotten onto the freeway, and was merging for the first time. I can only imagine that my Accord was mistaken identity. Don't remember what VC that was.

Front license plate missing fix-it tickets.

""Sign Violation"" VC cited for a U-turn I made where there happened to be a No-U-Turn Sign in one spot I didn't see. No one had to slow down or brake for my maneuver, but the generic VC for a ""sign violation"" cares not.

Bald tires ""fix it"" ticket - that one is part of the U-turn just above, where the officer got mad I noted on the ticket he refused the county seat, so he added this 2nd violation after I had already signed the ticket. I was found guilty on the sign violation at trial, not guilty on the bald tires, so I guess that makes 2 not guilty verdicts. Funny, since it was 1 count guilty 1 count not guilty I view that as a loss and didn't remember the win. Come to think of it, if you read my post above, that's the main reason I probably didn't appeal the decision, it was only half a loss.

3496,August 2,andres3,"I think what my ticket stories above show is that law enforcement is pretty incompetent and inept when they try to enforce anything other than speed laws. They are very experienced and therefore, more competent with the speeding tickets. On my ""maximum"" speed violations, they for the most part have the upper hand, and were correct that I was speeding per the letter of the law. Basic speed law is different, and gives me a fighting chance.

How far away was I when you estimated my speed? 2,000 feet?
How long does it take you to estimate a car's speed at that range? few seconds at least I'd imagine

How far away was I when you got/locked-in your radar reading?

What procedures do you go through to take a radar reading (push button, turn dial, whatever)

HOw long do those procedures take?

Did you use your radio?

Activate your lights and sirens?

How long does that take?

With questions like this you might just be able to show that his estimates are hogwash. Or the Officer might testify he instantaneously did 10 things all within a second, which seems overly confident to me. You may be able to show that at the speeds he testifies you were going, the ranges he testifies to are not accurate at all for the timeline given.

It's become all too routine and that's not necessarily a good thing. Men should explore all avenues of treatment before merely acquiescing to the knife, when it comes to the prostate. The aftereffects are often not the least bit pleasant. Depending on the age when you are diagnosed, it is often much smarter to live with it, as it is usually a very slowly progressing disease. So diet, exercise and close monitoring can give you your same natural life span as drastic surgical techniques.

Definitely not. I was on a 2 lane stretch of I-75, and I had followed these 2 flatbed transport trucks for about 20 minutes....one trying to pass the other. They had chains and steel loaded on the back like it could fly off at any time.....there were about 12 cars behind me all trying to get by.

Finally, finally, the truck in the passing lane gave up and fell back behind the right lane truck. Then I unleashed the horses in the 535 just to break ahead, break up the chain behind me, get ahead of the two wackos in the trucks with loose loads, and there was snooper trooper hiding in the bushes. I was already in the right lane letting everyone else go by. I think it was a set up.

That's true in some cases, but you need to understand exactly how aggressive the cancer is before you decide on treatment - the Gleason scale is used. The higher the Gleason score, the more aggressive the cancer. If you just watch a Gleason score 9 cancer that has spread outside the prostate, you could be dead in two years. Yes, the after effects of surgery can be a booger bear, but in some cases, you really don't have a choice as to surgery. Self-education on the subject and not just blindly following the doctor is the best course.

Speaking of scams on Craigslist...

I lost my yellow lab to lymphoma about a month ago, and I have been looking around for another dog as a companion to my remaining dog. I usually prefer to rescue an adult dog, and 2 of the last 3 have came from Craigslist. The exception, the one I still have, was a volunteer. I opened the front door one morning and she just waltzed in. Seven years later, she's still here, what can I say?

The yellow lab I just lost, she was from Craigslist. The guy had lost his job, they were foreclosing on his home, he, his wife, and his 2 kids were moving in with his brother, who rented, and no one had any money for a pet deposit. Very sad story, I even considered offering him the money for the pet deposit, but he wouldn't have been able to afford the other costs associated with pet ownership, so ...

It's become all too routine and that's not necessarily a good thing. Men should explore all avenues of treatment before merely acquiescing to the knife, when it comes to the prostate. The aftereffects are often not the least bit pleasant. Depending on the age when you are diagnosed, it is often much smarter to live with it, as it is usually a very slowly progressing disease. So diet, exercise and close monitoring can give you your same natural life span as drastic surgical techniques.
Re: having become too routine. There's a doctor in NYC who advertises his radiation treatment center for cancer on an hour long radio program in the middle of the night. He gives advice essentially that no one needs surgery as treatment for most cancers, including prostate cancer. I feel that's dangerous. I've heard area advertisements that 5 radiation treatments and you're cured. Zip. Boom. Bam. Done.

I talked to a surgeon who had treated prostate and other cancers with radiation when it was a fad several years back and preferred over surgery. The cells stop growing but some don't die and go dormant. Then they come back to life later after years. From what I can tell they usually have metastasized when they are found again.

Like many other cancers, it is best if found early. Brother, uncle, etc., or female relatives with gynecological cancer? Start getting PSA tests as a baseline. Cheap, even if your insurance doesn't pay. Usually insurance will have a reduced rate with the lap which you may pay instead of the rack rate.

I do think that Harley needs smaller less expensive bikes to compete with the likes of say a Honda Shadow 250. This would help bring in the younger bikers without a lot of money to spend and hopefully get their brand loyalty. Right now Harley seems to be attracting more middle aged adults looking at the image.

As for new vs used a lot of bikes are used mostly for weekend rides and then just a few weekends in the summer. So it's not unusual to be able to find a 5 year old bike with less than 10k on the clock. Mine was 3 years old with about 7k on it when i bought it. Outfitted the way it was i saved at least 35% off the MSRP brand new.

As for buying used i would be careful about Harleys. Not because they are bad bikes, they are pretty good, but because owners tend to do modifications on them some of which may harm the bike and some you may want to undo. 

Electric bikes are up and coming and you should start seeing more on the road, but i want a lot more range.

One thing that needs to be done across manufacturer lines is start offering more transmission choices. Honda seems to be making the push for dual clutch transmissions (mine has the DCT). This could bring in new riders weary of shifting a bike and keep older riders starting to have mobility issues.

Once again you have shown your good memory....just like an elephant, never forgetting. I don't watch Dr Phil but someone sent that segment and it was worth watching. I record the judges for when I do my weights 3X a week for 30 minutes, the shows are just the right length and I don't have to really concentrate (I used to watch news....but, not these days).
I think I have learned something about life observing some people. That G Class girl was an eye opener, I feel sorry for the guy who marries her. The Judge shows helped teach me how to detect who is lying - usually in these court battles some or both are lying to some degree. All that training helped me track down my S-I-L and helped me get the proof I needed to show his story about taking our car didn't add up.

I appreciate your trying to be helpful but in my case not very much. Let me explain.

I told about my experience with credit scores when we bought the '15 Genny in June of '15. The salesman comes back to the table and says, ""good news, you guys qualify for Hyundai's 0.9% financing for 60 months"". He didn't have to say that because I knew we had a good credit scores but since he mentioned it I asked what it was. He says, ""I have Mrs. jmonroe's credit report right here but I forgot to get a copy of yours"". So I asked what hers was and he said, ""883 out of a possible 900 which like I said is very good but I'll have to get you yours but I think it was 6 or 7 points lower than hers"". I looked over at Mrs. j and she had a smug look on her face that I have seen before. In the confusion of getting all the paper work signed I forgot to ask again for my printed credit report. So, as far as I'm concerned (playing mind games like @driver100 likes to do about seeing celebrities) the salesman could have been wrong and my score could have been at least as good as Mrs. j's, maybe even a little better but without proof I can't win that argument.

Fast forward to a couple of years ago when we were on the ""how do I get my credit score from my credit card company"" subject, our poster buddy @dino001 told me how to get mine from BA since he had a card with them also. When I went online to sign up it only had a spot for entering one Social Security number so I entered mine. Over all the months when I've checked it, when BA notified me via email that my bill could be viewed online, I used that opportunity to click on my credit score. It has varied a couple points or two but for about the last year it was stuck on 839 out of 850. When the online statement for July showed up, it now showed 845. Mrs. j was in the office watching TV when I saw my new number and I yelled out, ""YIPPEE, it's about time"". Just a little explanation here, she knows that the BA credit score is my score because of what I said above. OK, now that you guys know that, she says, ""yippee what""? So I told her I'm getting there and it won't be long before I have a perfect 850 out of 850 (like @dino001 was bragging about the other day). She said, ""if you used my Social Security number it would have been perfect for years now"". I've already showed her that she can't just add 6 or 7 points onto my score to indicate what hers would be because the scale is different but she conveniently forgets about that math. And when I cautiously remind her of it (to avoid another lap or two around the dining room table) she says, ""if yours can go up so can mine so mine has to be perfect by now"".

That is what I mean about being treated like Roger Dangerfield. Before anyone in here jumps me that I mean Rodney not Roger, I've already explained, Rodney gets no respect from his wife, whereas Roger's wife tortures him. On good days I am treated like Rodney but most of the time like Roger.

How much off is it? Our Enclave doesn’t get the EPA #s either, but certainly not the cars fault... more heavy right foot.
Well, I'm averaging anywhere from 25 to 28 MPG on average with heavy freeway driving in the Kia. The S4 would average about 24 I think with the same heavy foot and same commutes. My TTS averages 23; though I got 26.1 this morning.

Kia has very high optimistic EPA ratings for the 1.6T Eco model, particularly on the highway. I'd say the city mileage is close enough to not get mad about, but on the highway, even in little traffic, I'm not getting into the mid or high 30's. That's the reason I'm not getting 30 average, which is what I expected.

While I can expect maybe 10% less than the EPA numbers with my heavy foot, I don't expect 20% to 25% less.

Furthermore, it irks me that cars with double the horsepower are getting eerily close to the lackluster fuel economy of an ""eco"" model. I like power and efficiency to be combined in a refined drive train. Give me 300+ horsepower and I can forgive lesser fuel economy.

If someone enters your home you have no duty to retreat(although some idiot legislators have tried to require such a duty).

Well, I'm averaging anywhere from 25 to 28 MPG on average with heavy freeway driving in the Kia. The S4 would average about 24 I think with the same heavy foot and same commutes. My TTS averages 23; though I got 26.1 this morning.

Kia has very high optimistic EPA ratings for the 1.6T Eco model, particularly on the highway. I'd say the city mileage is close enough to not get mad about, but on the highway, even in little traffic, I'm not getting into the mid or high 30's. That's the reason I'm not getting 30 average, which is what I expected.

While I can expect maybe 10% less than the EPA numbers with my heavy foot, I don't expect 20% to 25% less.

Furthermore, it irks me that cars with double the horsepower are getting eerily close to the lackluster fuel economy of an ""eco"" model. I like power and efficiency to be combined in a refined drive train. Give me 300+ horsepower and I can forgive lesser fuel economy.

Oh not at all. But I've been in enough court rooms to see many different judges at work. In my earlier years, I actually enjoyed watching 10 trials after my own, and seeing 10 straight guilty verdicts.

I've seen and experienced enough judges that I can tell the difference. The worst one I've ran into was in El Cajon at a Motion Hearing. My second motion got no consideration. Zero. Zilch. Nada. Apparently my appearance as a Defendant Pro Se was offensive enough to have the first one denied, and on the basis of that, even though my 2nd motion had nothing to do with the first, was denied too!

When I told my recent lawyer about this incident, I got the impression they knew who I was talking about, and said she no longer works there (while discussing reasons I wanted a Change of Venue away from El Cajon, and spending extra to make it happen).

Another judge in Ventura left a sour impression. He seemed to be annoyed that I had to be punished for 97 MPH rather than 100 MPH. Deep down that guy wished I had been going 100 so he could really sock it to me, and bend me over.

To that I say ""GOOD!"" Some judges seem much too comfortable exerting the vast amount of power they have in their courtroom, with little regard to being overturned on appeal.

Anything to make them feel a bit less comfortable is a good thing in my opinion. Don't really want them to feel like a Tenured Professor. While they should not be scared into not doling out justice, they should be scared about doling out arbitrary and unfair rulings. My impression has been the ""fear"" of being overturned and overruled was not ""large"" enough in Traffic Court.

As you can see, even Federals Appeals Courts (high level) are routinely corrected by the SCOTUS. Sometimes even SCOTUS makes unanimous 9-0 decisions, which makes you wonder why it had to be taken that high in the first place!

And it might surprise you to learn that most of my citations over the years have been for ""gotcha"" violations. Not speeding. Not tailgating. Not unsafe lane changes. In fact, nothing unsafe of any kind. Technical violations at times, yes, sometimes, they just plain got it wrong.

It had been about 3 years since I had gotten the earlier vaccine. My doctor had given me the scare stories about patients she had who got shingles, especially those on the face nearing the eyes, where the optic nerves can be affected if infected.

Our shots cost $0.

But we pay for additional insurance coverage under my wife's retirement plan. It has been great for her surgeries. E.g., her recent thyroid cancer and parathyroidectomy with the advance testing using radioactive tracer studies to see where the active spots were in the thyroid and parathyroids along with ultrasound were about $100 for her part. The surgery chargers were under $100 for the surgeon, 3 anesthesiologist charges along with real time lab testing of the blood level of the parathyroid hormone during surgery. All that for 5.5 hours in hospital for a 3 hour planned surgery. We have NOT gotten a hospital bill. I'm betting we don't get one for the hospital itself since it's been 3 months. Normally hospital bills from there come in 1 month.

I like it. Not a whole lot of Green to buy it ($2,700????....maybe). Even if it has a little rust, so what at that price?

I think the angle of the pic makes some of it look a little off, but I would quiz the seller and see what s/he says.

I would also like to know what kind of driving is done. I cant get EPA numbers on the Chrysler in my normal stop and go commute but can beat it on weekend drives in the country. I once knew a guy that bought a Chevy Sonic who got nowhere near the EPA figures but he rarely drove it more that 5 miles at a time so it rarely got warmed up enough.

I'm usually not much for movies/movie stars but had a thing for her. She was in town shooting a movie and was staying downtown in a hotel about a block from my office.

One day at lunchtime I was out for a walk and went to a good newsstand/gift shop down the street to kill time. I was standing in front of a long wall of magazines browsing when I sensed someone standing next to me. I glanced over and did the classic double-take. It was Ms. Moore, looking rather stunning. She looked at me, smiled, and I was absolutely, totally tongue-tied. Could not think of a thing to say and I was a bit embarrassed, so I just smiled back and felt my face go red. Damn.

So it was just a person looking for the right house, your door was open, and she came in to check if she was in the right place. They weren’t burglars and you didn’t have to be rude. You could have just asked nicely what she was doing and then directed her to the right address. No need for drama or bothering the police. No need to lock your doors in the future either as it was not a thwarted burglary. Just a mistaken address. I’ve done that many times myself.
Really? You just walked in to a strangers house without knocking? You're lucky you haven't been shot.

Yeh, I meant to comment on that too. I think if someone shows up in your house you have to assume the worst until their story is clarified.

I have another one, Shifty.  I remember this vividly - one of the few things I do remember from my early boyhood.  On a Tuesday night when I was 8 years old, my brother and I were awakened by our parents at 9:30 PM (on school nights we were in bed by 8:00 PM) and were told we were going with my grandpa to Miami that night on an Eastern Airlines Super G Constellation.  They had packed our things while we were at school that day.  My Mom’s parents lived in Coral Gables (Miami) at the time and grandpa was in New York on a business trip.

My grandpa took us to Idlewild Airport (forerunner of JFK Airport) and we boarded the plane.  I remember that our departure was delayed a bit (scheduled for 12:00 midnight) as we were waiting for a passenger to arrive.  Back then, Night Flights were less expensive than day flights.  We finally took off and during the 4-1/2 hour flight, grandpa took us back to the tail section of the plane which was a lounge in those days.  As we entered the lounge, Milton Berle was sitting there smoking his cigar and drinking a cocktail.  He shook our hands and gave us each an autographed picture of himself 

For those of you old enough to remember his weekly TV program, he was aired live from New York every Tuesday night at 9:00 PM.  So he was late for the flight because of the long drive from Manhattan to Idlewild - no interstates back then.  Very exciting for both me and my brother.  

Mike, that is a very cool story. Milton Berle was one of the real giants of comedy and a pioneer of television. What a great memory for you!

I have a ""This could only happen to Mike"" story. An hour ago I was watching TV with my wife upstairs when I hear a female voice down in the living room. I go to the head of the stairs an see a middle age woman standing there who had just walked in to my house. I said ""who the heck are you?"" And she said something about looking for her cousin and ""maybe"" she was in the wrong house. I said "" so you're not sure of the house and you just walk in?"" I told her in no uncertain terms to get out and never come back. She left and got into a Honda Civic where a younger male driver was waiting. I got the plate and made a report to the police after they left.

I then got visits from two different police teams who went out and located the pair and determined that they were indeed looking for a particular address on my street. They said I did the right thing because often burglars will knock on your door and enter if there's no response. They send in an innocent looking person who can claim confusion if confronted. If the coast is clear the heavy lifter then comes in to steal your stuff.

For 35 years I've never locked my doors even when I'm away from home but I guess that will have to change.

This reminds me of an incident from around 1987 or so when I was invited to spend a week with my college buddy and his lovely wife, who were living at the time in Scarborough, Ontario. If you've ever been there you know it is suburbia on steroids, and the part where they lived was in a development of townhouses, hundreds or thousands of them, on typical winding suburban streets with no defining natural features. The housing units themselves were even all the same colors.

I had driven to Ontario and was there all week eating their food and drinking their booze, so a day or so before I was supposed to leave I decided to restock their fridge as thanks. I took my car to the supermarket and beer store, bought a bunch of stuff, and headed back. The way I had always identified their house was by seeing their second car parked in the driveway, an old white Chevette. I saw it, got out with my purchases, and walked in the unlocked front door of the house. I put the grocery bags down in the hall and was about to go back outside to get the case of beer when I looked up and realized I was in the wrong house. I saw or heard nobody so I picked up the bags, went outside onto the stoop and looked around. About 6-8 houses up was another white Chevette parked in a driveway. I quickly put all the stuff back in my car and drove up there. Fortunately this time I found the right place.

There's been a number of high profile cases like that. In general the person gets charged if they stupidly start shooting at someone OUTSIDE their house. Once a person comes inside the house the homeowner has greater latitude.

Yes, that I would like. I'd also like to meet Paul McCartney, but I don't feel awe. He has accomplished a lot in his life, and he has talent, plus worked hard to get where he did. I'd have a lot of questions for him, especially what the early days were like. I always thought I would like to meet Johnny Carson too.......he had this quick sharp sense of humor, and he played tennis on his own court a lot of the time...I would have liked to play tennis with him.

I drove a Black Altima to Burlington VT on Thursday. Very nice, 41.6 mpg but no swooning girls.

I have a ""This could only happen to Mike"" story. An hour ago I was watching TV with my wife upstairs when I hear a female voice down in the living room. I go to the head of the stairs an see a middle age woman standing there who had just walked in to my house. I said ""who the heck are you?"" And she said something about looking for her cousin and ""maybe"" she was in the wrong house. I said "" so you're not sure of the house and you just walk in?"" I told her in no uncertain terms to get out and never come back. She left and got into a Honda Civic where a younger male driver was waiting. I got the plate and made a report to the police after they left.

I then got visits from two different police teams who went out and located the pair and determined that they were indeed looking for a particular address on my street. They said I did the right thing because often burglars will knock on your door and enter if there's no response. They send in an innocent looking person who can claim confusion if confronted. If the coast is clear the heavy lifter then comes in to steal your stuff.

For 35 years I've never locked my doors even when I'm away from home but I guess that will have to change.
So it was just a person looking for the right house, your door was open, and she came in to check if she was in the right place. They weren’t burglars and you didn’t have to be rude. You could have just asked nicely what she was doing and then directed her to the right address. No need for drama or bothering the police. No need to lock your doors in the future either as it was not a thwarted burglary. Just a mistaken address. I’ve done that many times myself.

I have another one, Shifty.  I remember this vividly - one of the few things I do remember from my early boyhood.  On a Tuesday night when I was 8 years old, my brother and I were awakened by our parents at 9:30 PM (on school nights we were in bed by 8:00 PM) and were told we were going with my grandpa to Miami that night on an Eastern Airlines Super G Constellation.  They had packed our things while we were at school that day.  My Mom’s parents lived in Coral Gables (Miami) at the time and grandpa was in New York on a business trip.

My grandpa took us to Idlewild Airport (forerunner of JFK Airport) and we boarded the plane.  I remember that our departure was delayed a bit (scheduled for 12:00 midnight) as we were waiting for a passenger to arrive.  Back then, Night Flights were less expensive than day flights.  We finally took off and during the 4-1/2 hour flight, grandpa took us back to the tail section of the plane which was a lounge in those days.  As we entered the lounge, Milton Berle was sitting there smoking his cigar and drinking a cocktail.  He shook our hands and gave us each an autographed picture of himself 

For those of you old enough to remember his weekly TV program, he was aired live from New York every Tuesday night at 9:00 PM.  So he was late for the flight because of the long drive from Manhattan to Idlewild - no interstates back then.  Very exciting for both me and my brother.

I was very close with Don Drysdale and his wife (Annie Meyers Drysdale) and their kids.  I remember being at his funeral at Forest Lawn near Chavez Ravine.  At the memorial service, I was seated right next to Sandy Koufax.  My son sat next to Roosevelt Greer who took up 2 seats due to his size.  All the current and retired Dodgers were in attendance and the Emcee was Vin Scully. Very moving experience.
Earlier this week I read a piece in the L.A. Times about a new book by ex-Dodger Ron Fairly. It contained a story about Drysdale that made me laugh:

""Once in Chicago, Drysdale was drinking all night with Cubs infielder Don Zimmer, a former teammate. Before the next day’s game, Zimmer told his teammates that Drysdale, who was the Dodgers’ starting pitcher, was surely still drunk.

Drysdale, a 6-foot-6 bear of a man who was feeling fine, heard about what Zimmer was saying and decided to milk it. When the Cubs came to bat in the bottom of the first, Drysdale acted like he couldn’t see catcher John Roseboro, who was in on the joke.

Roseboro stood and shouted, “Over here!’’ to Drysdale, who promptly threw his first pitch over the batter’s head and to the backstop.

From the Cubs’ dugout, Drysdale heard frightened players muttering that he was, indeed, drunk. Nobody wanted to bat. Ron Santo came to the plate and shouted, “Hey Don, can you see me?’’

Drysdale knocked a few guys down before throwing a complete-game victory and striking out 10. After, he invited Zimmer to dinner again. Zimmer refused.""

In the early '70s Drysdale worked Montreal Expos games in his first job as a color commentator on their national CBC-TV broadcasts. He was very good at it and later moved to a similar role with ABC in the US.

Well spending the last few days here in Orlando with the grandkids. Almost pulled the trigger and bought a house. It was at one of the larger 55+ communities which had several villa homes which they used for putting up visitors who would come in for a couple of days to try out the community. These were fully finished 2 bedrooms with a study for $190k sitting on a lake. These were great boys (5 of the 8 were sold in less than a week). We were thinking of using it as a rental until we were ready to retire then move into it when we retire in 8 to 10 years.

For various reasons we pulled the plug on it right after we were approved for the loan. But the search goes on. 
You don’t really want a home on a lakefront property here in Florida - alligators, iguanas, snakes, flooding, to name a few reasons.  Orlando is nice, but the traffic on I-4 and feeder roads and streets can be miserable due to all the attractions.

You might want to consider the Jacksonville area.  You get cooler temps in winter (40-50 at night) and daytime temps are comfy (65-75).  Lots of new development south and west of Jacksonville.

You are 100% right, suydam.  June through October is brutal in the Coachella Valley.  This past week my son called to tell me it hit 120 degrees in the shade.  This is a departure from average daytime temps of 104-108 F.  Yes, it’s dry like an oven, but 108-120 F is murder.

The Low Desert is great to live in from November through May.  The High Desert (Las Vegas) is brutal in summer and cold in winter.

Northern Florida has a great climate - but still hot and humid in summer.  Many Palm Desert area residents have summer homes in the San Diego area or Laguna Beach where it’s cooler because of the cold Pacific Ocean.

Actually, I could not afford to live out there.  Average monthly rentals are $1200-$2000 a month.  Sales taxes are 8%-8.5% on everything.  Gasoline is 1 dollar more a gallon than here.  State income taxes are brutal.  Summers are brutal.  I would need to have spendable income at $100,000 a year or more, which is way more than my monthly income now.  Even annual car registration is over $1000 for my car.  Utilities are high.

I agree I should be nearer to my family but I just can’t right now.  My son earns over $90,000 a year and barely makes it each month.

I fly a lot, mostly with Delta, which I have 2 million miles logged.

Anyway, they used to upgrade me fairly regularly to first class given my “status”. That doesn’t happen much any more as they’d rather leave a first class seat empty rather than have to spend an extra $20 for a couple of beers and crappy food that I would cost them.

Anyway, I flew quite often to CA from Cincinnati. Delta had a hub here at the time. So, it was a connecting point from flights coming from the East or the South.

Going to CA I got to my seat. Already sitting there was a guy who looked kind of familiar but I couldn’t put my finger on who he was. Normally I do work on those long flights (4 hours) and leave my seat mate alone. This guy started a conversation and asked about what I did, where I actually lived (Cincinnati), etc.

Finally, wheels up and the tiny screens dropped down to play the inflight movie. Movie had Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman in it, so I was mildly interested in seeing it. The movie’s name was “Practical Magic”. The male lead comes on screen and looks a whole lot like the guy sitting next to me. I look at the screen, and then back at him a couple of times. He looks at me and says “yeah......I still can’t get used to seeing myself on any sort of screen”. It was Aiden Quinn. Cool guy. We talked the rest of the flight.

I had a similar experience on a non-stop flight from Ft. Lauderdale to Los Angeles on an American Airlines flight a few years back.  It was a Boeing 757 so the main entry to the plane was just behind first class.  I was upgraded to first class and my seat was just behind the bulkhead next to the window.  But when I got there after boarding, I saw the head of a man who was sitting in my seat.  I thought I should seek out the flight attendant so as not to create an uncomfortable discussion why he should move to his assigned seat.  So I went to the flight attendant and told her my problem.  She said to me, “...you must be Mr. Si....r.  Welcome aboard.  The gentleman in your seat asked me to give you this envelope.”  So I opened the envelope and there were 5 crisp new $100 bills in it with a note asking if I would mind sitting in the aisle seat.  It was signed “Marc Anthony”, the recording star.  I walked up to him, returned his $500 and said to him, “...can I buy a few hours of conversation from you?”  He smiled and said “sure”!

Back in the late 50's and early 60's my uncle knew a guy that helped put on a dinner and gathering of present and past sport celebrities (around a dozen or so) at a night club in my town to help raise money for a veterans group. He was always given several free tickets (don't know what the real cost was) and he and his oldest son along with my father and my middle brother and I heard at least two hours of stories like that.

Just a quick story that I remember told by Joe Garagiola (one time catcher in the majors with a few teams and even spent a couple years with the Pirates). Joe was not a very good hitter but he was a pretty good catcher, so I was told.

One time Joe came to the plate with the bases loaded and two outs. He hit a double that scored two runs. If it wasn't for a slow poke who had to stop at third he would have had a bases clearing double. However, he was still very excited since he rarely got hits like that. Joe takes a big lead off second wanting to make sure he'll score if the guy at the plate gets a hit. Then because of his excitement he decides to steal third, forgetting that there is a guy on third. When Joe slides into third, the guy on third looks down and yells, ""Joe, where the hell are you going? Joe looked up and said, ""back to second if I can make it"". He didn't and that killed the inning.

Baseball seems to generate more funny stories than any other sport. Maybe it is due to the slow pace of the game and the long 162-game season leading to lots of extended time on the road. Garagiola and Bob Uecker made careers out of baseball humor, a lot of it at their own expense. I bought Uecker's autobiography ""Catcher in the Wry"" when it came out in the early '80s. There is a section of pictures in it, one of which is a shot of him sliding into home plate with a determined look on his face. The caption always broke me up.

Do many elderly have a hip ""break"" and then they fall. The break is due to osteoporosis or other bone deterioration, but the victim doesn't realize which happened first. I was told that was what happened with my brother a few years ago. He had been in a nursing home without much activity and the bone deteriorated from not being used to carry normal weight, in my opinion.
The break before the fall happens often due to osteoporosis. Exersize can mitigate it somewhat but it's the chemical leaching of the calcium that weakens the bone. My grandmother had her hip break as she was walking down the stairs and my father's went while playing basketball with my kids. Fortunately these days they can slap in a new hip and off you go.

Good story @ab.

Back in the late 50's and early 60's my uncle knew a guy that helped put on a dinner and gathering of present and past sport celebrities (around a dozen or so) at a night club in my town to help raise money for a veterans group. He was always given several free tickets (don't know what the real cost was) and he and his oldest son along with my father and my middle brother and I heard at least two hours of stories like that.

Just a quick story that I remember told by Joe Garagiola (one time catcher in the majors with a few teams and even spent a couple years with the Pirates). Joe was not a very good hitter but he was a pretty good catcher, so I was told.

One time Joe came to the plate with the bases loaded and two outs. He hit a double that scored two runs. If it wasn't for a slow poke who had to stop at third he would have had a bases clearing double. However, he was still very excited since he rarely got hits like that. Joe takes a big lead off second wanting to make sure he'll score if the guy at the plate gets a hit. Then because of his excitement he decides to steal third, forgetting that there is a guy on third. When Joe slides into third, the guy on third looks down and yells, ""Joe, where the hell are you going? Joe looked up and said, ""back to second if I can make it"". He didn't and that killed the inning.

Heard stories like that, one after another after another. Left that place with my sides hurting due to laughing. One more part of my life I'll never see again.

A few years ago I was in a checkout line at the supermarket when I noticed the lady behind me in the line staring at me. This is always a concern because my first thought is that something is wrong - is my fly open, is there soup on my shirt, has a large stinging insect landed on me? She noticed that I noticed and finally said with a look of hope on her face, ""Are you... uh, are you Dr. Phil?""

I should have thought more quickly and responded in the affirmative with his accented voice but was startled so I said no. She was very disappointed.
Not to steal your thunder but I had a young girl at a local department store think I was the character that played the part of a spy in a movie series. This was not long before we were married. This girl was beautiful but not much between the ears. It happened as I took a shirt to the register:

Girl: OH,OH,OH, your him. I can't believe it. Are you really him, really?

Remembering that people had told me that I looked like Dean Martin I said.

Me: Oh, you mean Dean Martin. No, I'm not him.

Girl: NO, NO, not him. Who is that?

Now I don't know what to say.

Girl: The guy that plays a spy in the movies.

Then it clicked because the Matt Helm movie series was popular back them. So I asked.

Me: Do you mean Matt Helm?

Girl: Yeah, yeah, that's who I mean. Can I have your autograph?

No matter what I said she still thought I was Matt Helm and wanted my autograph.

Girl: Here, write it here on this piece of paper.

Finally she asks a coworker.

Coworker: No that isn't Matt Helm but he does look a little like Dean Martin.

Girl: That's what he said too. What does he do?

Like I said, beautiful girl but she should have gone into modeling or even acting. She was wasting her time as a department store clerk.

Now THIS is disturbing:

Apparently, the USA has the highest road death fatality rate in the industrialized world. On any given summer's day, about 100 Americans die in a car. You name it---texting, drunk drivers, or being a pedestrian hit by any of the above. Saturday is the most lethal day.

Interestingly, the death rate has been going down in some categories, but motorcyclists have not benefited at all from any safety regulations.

With some exceptions within the following age group, road crashes are the leading cause of death for Americans between the ages of 3 and 34 (as of 2014).


Unfortunately the people in charge tend to think doubling down on all the wrong things we do (like extra low speed limits) will turn things around. Pretty insane. You know, the trying the same thing over and over again and expecting different results routine?

I've found it''s much easier to just mirror and copy a system that already works well. Say..... Germany.

Instead you have the IIHS and NHTSA making purely speculative alternate reality propaganda that still insists we'd have a much bigger population boom right now if we hadn't of repealed the 55 MPH speed limit in the 90's.

You guys know I used to live in Palm Desert, CA from 1991-1998 and then northern Los Angeles from 1998-2000.

Palm Desert is one of several cities in the Coachella Valley which include Palm Springs, Cathedral City, Rancho Mirage, Bermuda Dunes, Indian Wells, La Quinta and Indio.  Many Movie and TV stars and professional athletes own winter homes in Rancho Mirage, Palm Desert, Indian Wells and La Quinta and a few in Palm Springs.  So during the winter, it is quite common to be seated in a restaurant and have a star or sports legend seated at the next table.

I also had a number of kids at the school I ran whose parents were pro athletes or TV/Movie stars.  I remember sitting next to Tim Conway and his wife at a restaurant in Rancho Mirage.  A few weeks later I was at a concert in Rancho Mirage and Tommy LaSorta was sitting right next to me.  It was quite common in the Coachella Valley to see stars walking on the street or at the movies or at restaurants.

I was very close with Don Drysdale and his wife (Annie Meyers Drysdale) and their kids.  I remember being at his funeral at Forest Lawn near Chavez Ravine.  At the memorial service, I was seated right next to Sandy Koufax.  My son sat next to Roosevelt Greer who took up 2 seats due to his size.  All the current and retired Dodgers were in attendance and the Emcee was Vin Scully. Very moving experience.

What I miss most about my years in Palm Desert is being with my son and my grandchildren.  But I also miss the laid back embiance of the Desert Cities and the non-challant pace of daily life among the stars intermingling in the lives of every-day people.

On another front, I took a nasty fall yesterday. My glasses fell off and I hit my left upper cheek just to the left of my left eye on a railing and the blood was everywhere. Bruised on both arms, my left side and my whole body aches.

I was reading somewhere that senior citizens fall frequently with broken hips the most common fall injury. In my case, I am swollen all over my arms and face. No broken bones, at least to the best of my knowledge.
Hope you'll be over the pain soon. Also hope you know how it happened so that it doesn't happen again.

FWIW, last Thursday while leaving her water aerobics class, Mrs. j tripped over a mat out in front of the place and landed on the right side of her jaw and bit into the top inside of her upper lip. The girls called for an ambulance and she had to have 3 stiches. Her lip swelled up pretty good and she looked like I got in a good left hook.

Hope you'll be over the pain soon. Also hope you know how it happened so that it doesn't happen again.

FWIW, last Thursday while leaving her water aerobics class, Mrs. j tripped over a mat out in front of the place and landed on the right side of her jaw and bit into the top inside of her upper lip. The girls called for an ambulance and she had to have 3 stiches. Her lip swelled up pretty good and she looked like I got in a good left hook. She had to break her fall with her hands or it would have been much worse. Looks pretty much like her old self now.

Keep us up do date on your progress.

Ouch! Poor Mrs. jmonroe - good thing she only bit into the top inside of her upper lip - could have been so much worse.

As for the ""how it happened"" learning lesson, I know exactly what caused it. Back when I was in graduate school, a bunch of the guys decided to play softball. I hit a grounder to the third baseman and as I was crossing over first base, I landed in such a way that my left knee dislocated. They took me to the hospital and they did an emergency procedure in the operating room to put my knee back into its natural state. Unfortunately for me, my left common peroneal nerve was severed at the knee joint causing me to lose motion and feeling on parts of my lower left leg and several toes as well as ankle movement. There was a ton of damage done to my ligaments, tendons and my patella. After 6 hours of surgery the following week and two more surgeries to repair the nerve, I went into rehab for a month.

I wore a lower leg brace conneted to my shoe with a spring-loaded mechanism so I would have a more natural walking gate. After many months of physical therapy, they decided that due to the severed nerve, I would develop a ""drop foot"" on my left leg. So, sometimes I trip on things like sidewalk cracks that are uneven or carpeting - come to think about it - just about everything. I just have to be careful with this limitation I have. So that's the long and the short of it (mostly long). I am paralyzed on my left foot - cannot raise the foot at all.

On another front, I took a nasty fall yesterday. My glasses fell off and I hit my left upper cheek just to the left of my left eye on a railing and the blood was everywhere. Bruised on both arms, my left side and my whole body aches.

I was reading somewhere that senior citizens fall frequently with broken hips the most common fall injury. In my case, I am swollen all over my arms and face. No broken bones, at least to the best of my knowledge.
Sorry to hear that, Mike. I hope you make a speedy recovery.

You are correct (as usual) about senior citizens falling frequently. My sense of balance is not what it used to be. Sometimes just walking down the street I will weave a little bit. Normally it's not a problem, but I do have to be very careful when leaning over as it is very easy to lose my balance and need to grab something.

Getting old is definitely not for wussies, but yes, it is still better than the alternative!

Do many elderly have a hip ""break"" and then they fall. The break is due to osteoporosis or other bone deterioration, but the victim doesn't realize which happened first. I was told that was what happened with my brother a few years ago. He had been in a nursing home without much activity and the bone deteriorated from not being used to carry normal weight, in my opinion.

As for you braking your wrist twice, you are one ahead of me. If anyone remembers last August, one day before we were going on vacation, I fell off a four foot wall along the driveway that I have navigated umteen times over the years but that day I missed a step and over I went. Skinned up both palms, both elbows and both knees along with having a very sore right wrist. When Mrs. j saw all the blood she got worried but while I was laying there on my back, I remember saying, ""it looks worse than it is but this wrist is going to hurt like a bit** tomorrow morning"". Because I could move it in all directions I didn't think it was broken. Then when we got back from vacation I decided to go to the emergency room because even though the swelling was almost gone, it was still sore. Sure enough an X-ray showed a break. Even the doctor didn't think it was broken because I could move it so well.

So...given that I live in a market that is an anomaly (and one that seems to actually be slowing down), we realized a 40% ROI in 3 years of ownership of our first home in Seattle. We had to use all of that gain as a downpayment in order to fit our current home within our budget. Our current home sold for exactly the same as we paid for our first home 3 years ago, just is bigger and located in the suburbs.

We were lucky and had the funds for our first down payment to be able to purchase when we did, or we would be like our friends and stuck putting every dime of our savings into a home. My issue is that while they are ""in"" the market and likely realizing excellent gains, same as we did, they are cash flow strapped and have no emergency fund. I can't live like that and probably wouldn't live like that.
Sounds like a recipe for disaster, and eerily similar to what happened in 2008 and 2009. Why would you want to be in a position where if you lose your job your forclosing as soon as the bank can do it.

I actually disagree with the math. Nobody showed me a comprehensive calculation that includes all costs of home ownership and compares them with costs of renting. It's not there, because real estate industry would kill any suggestion the math may not be as great. Another reason is large number of variables, not conducive for general public to actually understand a multivariable calculation. It's usually couple of great sounding one-liners, like ""you lock in your payment, think how many times your landlord will raise the rent"", aimed at ending any in-depth discussion about the subject and going with the warm feelings.

BTW, really poor guy will never get approved for any kind of decent mortgage in a decent house in a safe neighborhood. Not so poor guy will have enough to get a decent rental, save the rest and invest it on a side.

For years we heard ""houses never lose value"". Well, they did big. Mine still didn't recover from its 2005 peak. 13 years later it's still worth below what people thought it was worth then. But even if its value rose by 50 or 75 percent in that time, I'd still maintain there were better ""investments"". I like my place, I'm not selling it and I'm not moving. I just refuse to give in into illusions, which makes me a bit strange guy. It feels sometimes like this guy who exposes alchemist's scam of turning lead into gold and gets burned on the stake (not the alchemist, the guy who exposed him).
that's how i feel when I expose the NHTSA and IIHS as the political propaganda machines they are.

Home ownership should be no investment unless you have more than one. Your home is where you want to live....nothing more, nothing less. Whether prices go down or up, you need a place to live, that is what a home should be.


Some examples of why home investment can be bad....really bad;
1. Before we bought, we rented a townhouse in Florida. The people we rented it from bought it as an investment. Paid $650000 for it, used is $250000 pension money from Southwest as the down payment. They had to walk away when the value decreased to $250000 in 2008.
2. My brother rented his apartment 35 years ago......rent was $550 a month. Everyone told him to buy, and since then condo prices have probably tripled or quadrupled. But, because of rent controls he ended up paying $930 a month after 35 years. His rent didn't even double over that time....now who is the smart one?
3. Our place in Florida reached a peak of being worth about $220000 just before the crash of 2008. We bought it for $125000 in 2011. Original price 22 years ago was about $110000, Our home is worth maybe $160 to $170K, but I am not a financial genius, just bought at the right time....still, not a huge profit over 7 years, especially if you include costs to maintain, taxes, etc. It is buying a lifestyle....that is what it is....I don't consider it an investment at all. If it goes up great, it doesn't really matter.
1. Had to walk away? I don't think so. Chose to more likely.
2. LOL
3. Agreed. But CA does make property tax cheap for those that bought cheap.

@tbirdmarco ....When I first got out of college, my first ""real"" job was with Xerox. I was a tech representative at the time, the guy who fixed their ""Star"" system. That was essentially a typewriter(s) that was wired directly into their print shop. It was all hooked together via ethernet and the first real ""network"" I was really aware of.

So, what's this have to do with your cold calling interview?

Well, after about a year of being the tech rep, the Star sales rep was let go as she had a hard time hitting her quota on a consistent basis. Since I was providing her a lot of leads, the viewed me as a potential and successful sales person. Most of the offices I visited had temp workers manning the typewriters and print shop. They would spend a month or so with one company and then would be moved to the next. They knew exactly which companies needed such a system as Xerox's Star System. They would let me know who they were....mainly large legal and financial firms.

I resisted going into sales. I did not want to be a sales person and didn't have any experience in sales.

My boss at the time said the Sales Manager would send me for sales training. If after 6 months in the field as a sales person I was not successful, or still did not like it, I could have my old job back as a Tech.

Not sure about today, but back in the late '80s when I first started working for them, Xerox sales training was considered the best in the world.

In 6 months, I was the 2nd revenue producer of Star Systems in all of Xerox. I made more money that I ever thought possible. I was hooked.

But, the least favorite part of my job was cold calling, which I did for 8-9 hours every Tuesday to set up demos and appointments for the rest of the week and into the next week. Lots and lots of phone work was involved. Sometimes once I finished one meeting, I'd look in the same office building for firms that may be able to use one of our Star Systems and would cold call in person. Again, hated doing that.

Over time, I didn't have any time for cold calling, however. I was just asking my customers for their introductions to other companies they thought might be a potential customer. Funny how lawyers and legal personnel all seem to know each other, regardless of the firms they worked for.

Parlayed that into a 10 year career with Xerox. Went onto become a Sales Manager, a Sales Training Manager (based in Leesburg, VA), a District Manager and finally the Director of Marketing for their (then new) color printers and copiers.

Since then I seem to have been in demand and have worked for companies small and large, with several startups during the (then) exploding tech arena in the '90s.

It all starts with cold calling, though.

If Craig @isellhondas is still around, he'll probably concur. So will @driver100.

The key is to have a clear upward path from the cold calling position. If successful, it can be very lucrative.

Good luck!

BTW....what will you be selling?
I'm the personality type where sales is a bit voodoo cult-like for me. It's hard to separate my own view point on sales when trying to sell something myself. My personality type is that ""if I needed your product, I'd have found it myself already.""

While this is true, big companies borrow tons of money to finance equipment, mergers, & acquisitions.  The companies constantly refinance debt to make it look like they have higher profit margins.  Higher profit margins equal higher stock prices.  Food for thought from a simple guy who sells toilets for a living.

Quite a story GG. My father told me if you want to earn good money, after being a professional like a doctor, lawyer or dentist, the best road is sales. You don't even need a good education.

I think, a good salesman should believe in his product. And, you have to listen to the potential buyer and show him how your product will make his life better.

When I wanted to put our books into a large chain store my goal was to make the buyer look like a hero, here was a product that would boost his sales....and make him into a hero.

Quite a story GG. My father told me if you want to earn good money, after being a professional like a doctor, lawyer or dentist, the best road is sales. You don't even need a good education.

I think, a good salesman should believe in his product. And, you have to listen to the potential buyer and show him how your product will make his life better.

When I wanted to put our books into a large chain store my goal was to make the buyer look like a hero, here was a product that would boost his sales....and make him into a hero.

You never know who your next big customer is.....the only way to find him is to go out and start knocking on doors.

Xerox was excellent at training sales people. If you couldn’t succeed with their (constant) training, you should look for a different kind of work.

In the 3 years I was in sales with Xerox, I think I went back to classes at least once every 6 months. There was basic, advanced, strategic, enterprise and some other sales courses they taught me that I used to make me successful.

Any sales person who says you don’t have to know your product to be successful, isn’t a very good sales person. This is particularly true in high tech sales where potential customers need to get knuckle deep into the product to find a fit.

That’s what always shocked me about some car sales people. If you know more than your car sales person, it’s probably a fair guess that the sales person learns his/her products quickly, or that person will fail.

Establishing rapport and finding out needs is certainly important, too. But, even if you find out what your potential customer wants/needs, but don’t know your own product enough to find a fit, you’re not going to make the sale in all likelihood.

As much as I hated cold calling, I do miss the sales end of my previous jobs. Nothing feels better than to know you did a good job for your customer and they’re happy with you.....and knowing your company is going to reward you (well) for the good job you did.

Met a lot of different people, too.....some remain friends with me to this day. Some even call me to consult on other tech projects they find themselves involved in.

I feel the same towards my Acura and BMW sales people, too. They know me. I know them. They know their products, WELL!. They make buying their products simple for me.

3809,July 26,henryn,"The comments about credit scores made me go look at mine. 698. The last time I looked, a few months back, it was 783. Probably dropped because I financed that new truck. Which was only temporary anyway, just to get the $750 kick back from Ford Motor Credit. In 91 days, when I pay off the loan, will my credit score bounce back as fast as it went down? Don't know, don't care really.

One interesting note. I financed about $14k, and while I was doing the financial part, I was talking to the finance guy about when it was okay to pay it off. Still 90 days, just like before. Not that you have to wait that long, but they really appreciate it if you do. And I always try to treat people fairly, at least as long as they do the same.

So the interesting part, the finance guy says some people will pay the bulk of the loan at the first payment date, thus reducing the interest over the next two months. He assured me that would not be a problem for the dealership. I did a quick calculation, 6.9% on $14k, that’s about $80 a month in interest. Just something new (at least new to me).

When I got mine, it dropped by 25 points or so for a few months, before it started climbing back. I suspect you might have shopped around for that truck a bit too long and checked several places in more than week or two (don't remember), which makes it multiple inquiries and hits the credit. Now it doesn't matter - you have your truck, just pay it and it will rise in time. No, it won't got up instantly on the payoff. BTW, 6.9% is ridiculously high, almost hard to believe it was a prime credit. The dealer must have marked it up by two or three percent. At this point, the credit score is the least of the worry.

3825,July 26,berri,"The credit rating score calculations are as bogus as z score calculations for potential bankruptcy in my book. A credit score totally ignores a person's net worth and cash flow. A z score over emphasizes current assets which means a company with high receivables and/or inventories is enhanced, when both of those situations are actually potential signs of a cash crisis.

I've never seen a formula or analysis on owning v renting that is comprehensive and realistic. On the buying side they tend to ignore the not insignificant costs of buying and selling a house in the calculations. They also tend to ignore the mathematics of a compound interest curve that often result in a 30 year mortgage costing 3X the original mortgage when held to maturity, or leading to an average 7 year house ownership life having payments that are mostly interest and little principal. On top of that, the tax deduction is nice (but now reduced for many) but still it really only saves (returns) your tax bracket percentage of your tax and interest payouts (eg. if you pay $10K in interest and taxes with a 20% tax bracket you have effectively reduced your taxes by $2K, not $10K). On the renting side, they tend to underestimate rents rising annually and the fact that as the landlord has increased taxes and maintenance they will pass most of it off to you through those rent increases. The pro renting side tends to rely on the ""investment"" of the upfront home purchase and down payment savings in stocks, bonds, etc. except many don't actually do that, while the pro buying side tends to rely on capital gains when you sell - both are ""potential"", not guaranteed. Seems to me that if you have a $2K monthly rent, over time you would have probably spent around half of that on average on home maintenance, repairs, taxes and the like if you owned a place, so your effective rent difference is more like $1K than the full $2K rent.

I find the field of artificial intelligence interesting. Basically, it appears to rely on developing computer algorithms often based on formula calculations. This is supposed to beat the human mind because it is ""impartial and not emotional"", except the algorithm and formula methods are developed by the human brain, so in fact cannot be totally objective either really. In investment, no edge tends to last very long because regardless of methodology Wall Street has always been notorious for herd mentality.

Now income inequality doesn't appear to be effecting the markets right now because they are doing well. However, when you look at economic history, whether the US depressions and deep recessions, or the rise and fall of other country economies, the similarity that seems to generally stand out is the erosion of the middle class because without a strong middle class over time their are fewer dollars out there chasing goods and services. Economic impacts tend to happen slowly until they crash toward the end.

He has gone to ground, I hope. I won a contest decades ago and luckily I had an unlisted phone number. My employer was mentioned once and I got mail from there from ""financial advisers"" wanting to be my best friend.

My dentist was my true best friend because he told me to see his accountant in the city (Cincinnati) before I did anything. I was on the phone the next day.

Occasionally I waste money on a lottery ticket and I worry about having to find an attorney to set up the proper screens to accept the money for me with only a minimum of exposure which many of the lottery systems require for advertising purposes so they can sucker in other gamblers. But it would be fun to take the money in 26 year installments and leave those to my son and his wife-to-be since I won't last another 26 years.

Quite true, driver. Happily, the absence of a mortgage means one's ""rent"" is pretty darn cheap. If I include all my housing-related fixed expenses (property taxes and utilities), I'm at about $650 a month. For this area, that's equivalent to a 500 square-foot dry cabin off in some mosquito-infested swamp.

I don't regard house (used as a primary residence) as an investment - it's a life style choice. A good one and bringing lots of joy, but as an investment house stinks (most of the time, most of the cases). Even when the price appreciation is high (like in some areas), overall cost of owning a house (from mortgage, to upkeep, to insurance, to improvements, to taxes, to everything else) outweighs ""investment benefits"". People will always quote price A they bought and price B as they sold and claim they ""made"" B-A on the house. Never mind all those mentioned costs they had to bear over the years (they somehow don't count). Never mind agent fees.

House is a great investment for a bank, not the owner-resident. Especially in America, when people own their houses for less than 10 years at a time. I don't count professional house investing (for rent or flip), as those are ruled by different dynamics. Even if one buys a house and then enjoys real boom in its value, it usually creates a lot of strain on them as they may not have cash flow to support increased taxes, insurance due to that growth. They can easily become house rich, cash poor. If they tap into that equity without income supporting it, we have foreclosure within couple of years. Also, if you buy a house and enjoy it going up in value, you still made nothing if you have to stay in the area (all other houses also increased in value). This happens for a lot of people, when they move from place to place, buying a house each time. They end up paying enormous amounts in closing/selling costs that they never seem to have accounted in their overly optimistic math of ""investment"". So, unless you move to middle of nowhere, you ""made"" nothing just yet. Perhaps, tapping into equity in reverse mortgage might get you some value in the old age.

As I said, it's a great life choice, but it's a terrible ""investment"". At best, it may be a ""store of value"" for some and perhaps force savings vehicle for those who are responsible enough to pay their bills, but otherwise spend every cent they get. However, those who know how to save, can invest in much better assets without bearing the costs - provided they can live in a rented apartment or house and put that difference away.

To take any kind of loan, you need to have a capacity to pay it back. Or at least used to... So if you bought a cheap house on low income then it rose in value way past your ability to buy it again, you can't take the loan, unless you wish to be foreclosed. Even HELOC, as it can be recalled and still needs to be paid according to some schedule. Now, if you invest the money into something making a better return, but it's now taking double risk (the investment and the house). I also agree, dependency of our economy on bricks and mortar rather than productive assets is something to be concerned about, not to celebrate.

You paint a very bleak picture. Someone once said that the only things we really know are those things that we learned through personal experience.

1. To appreciate 150 grand in 10 years, how much did you pay? Say it appreciated 5 percent per year (above average), it would be $240K. If it is 3 percent (typical long term), it would have to be $440K. Big difference. What makes you think you can achieve consistently above average house appreciation?
2. Where do you go after you sell? How much it costs?
3. I'd say it's quite likely that if the appreciation was average, $150K was easily eaten by taxes, insurance, living costs and closing costs/selling expenses. But say it's just half of it, more likely two-thirds, especially if you experience only average price appreciation (higher starting price). If you actually took a 30 year mortgage and paid nothing extra, you still owe more than 75 percent of the original amount, so most of your payments went to cover interest. No, my friend, you didn't make $150K. You'd be lucky to cash 50 grand, which is better to have or not, but I can think of much better schemes to turn this kind of money into real 150 grand. But you wouldn't have enjoyed your house, which is nice thing and there is nothing wrong with that. It's actually great. Just not as investment.

You misunderstand my intention. I think house is a great place for a family to grow up in. But it's much more expensive than anybody wants to admit, because people think it would make them look bad, as they had overspent. So they disregard those costs in the calculus and overexpose benefits.

You with your ability to actually save the cash and roll it forward, are an exemption, not rule. Majority of people I see, never get from the thumb of the debt, definitely not in 10 years from first purchase, because every penny they make goes to cover the interest and expenses and life. They usually have very little equity after 10 years, as second mortgage would eat all the possible appreciation. BTW, I almost paid off my house, on schedule to do it in less than 3 years (could send a check now, if wanted to), so I'm not talking about myself.

3845,July 26,28firefighter,"So...given that I live in a market that is an anomaly (and one that seems to actually be slowing down), we realized a 40% ROI in 3 years of ownership of our first home in Seattle. We had to use all of that gain as a downpayment in order to fit our current home within our budget. Our current home sold for exactly the same as we paid for our first home 3 years ago, just is bigger and located in the suburbs.

We were lucky and had the funds for our first down payment to be able to purchase when we did, or we would be like our friends and stuck putting every dime of our savings into a home. My issue is that while they are ""in"" the market and likely realizing excellent gains, same as we did, they are cash flow strapped and have no emergency fund. I can't live like that and probably wouldn't live like that.

I actually disagree with the math. Nobody showed me a comprehensive calculation that includes all costs of home ownership and compares them with costs of renting. It's not there, because real estate industry would kill any suggestion the math may not be as great. Another reason is large number of variables, not conducive for general public to actually understand a multivariable calculation. It's usually couple of great sounding one-liners, like ""you lock in your payment, think how many times your landlord will raise the rent"", aimed at ending any in-depth discussion about the subject and going with the warm feelings.

BTW, really poor guy will never get approved for any kind of decent mortgage in a decent house in a safe neighborhood. Not so poor guy will have enough to get a decent rental, save the rest and invest it on a side.

For years we heard ""houses never lose value"". Well, they did big. Mine still didn't recover from its 2005 peak. 13 years later it's still worth below what people thought it was worth then. But even if its value rose by 50 or 75 percent in that time, I'd still maintain there were better ""investments"". I like my place, I'm not selling it and I'm not moving. I just refuse to give in into illusions, which makes me a bit strange guy.

Yeah, ""perfect score"" is generally lots of credit available, very little actually taken at the moment of scoring, long history of paying on time (that's obvious), no recent shopping (inquiries) and no recently open accounts - at least one year; I started my car loan in May last year. The most entertaining is reading those ""negative"" factors on explanations. They can be completely contradictory to each other. At this level, one should never even bother reading that junk, as it's fractions of points. The important stuff is pay it on time, don't take more than you can handle and keep balances on your CC low vs. limits, including those you pay off every month. The score ""doesn't know"" you are going to pay it off. It takes snapshot of what the CC company billed to you last month. So if you have frequent large spending sprees (e.g. going on business paying by CC and getting reimbursed), make your CC company raise the limit far beyond what you are spending.

Marco, one of the hardest things in the world to do is cold calling. You have to know you will be rejected at least 90% of the time.

In my ""Entrepreneurial Course"" we had a lesson called making cold calling warmer. It was to send a letter in advance so they will be expecting you. You have to get a name....call first, and write a nice letter telling the person you want to see that you would like to talk to him. Make it friendly, informal, and you are just looking for advice etc.....not going to be demanding a job. Good luck!

@tbirdmarco ....When I first got out of college, my first ""real"" job was with Xerox. I was a tech representative at the time, the guy who fixed their ""Star"" system. That was essentially a typewriter(s) that was wired directly into their print shop. It was all hooked together via ethernet and the first real ""network"" I was really aware of.

So, what's this have to do with your cold calling interview?

Well, after about a year of being the tech rep, the Star sales rep was let go as she had a hard time hitting her quota on a consistent basis. Since I was providing her a lot of leads, the viewed me as a potential and successful sales person. Most of the offices I visited had temp workers manning the typewriters and print shop. They would spend a month or so with one company and then would be moved to the next. They knew exactly which companies needed such a system as Xerox's Star System. They would let me know who they were....mainly large legal and financial firms.

I resisted going into sales. I did not want to be a sales person and didn't have any experience in sales.

My boss at the time said the Sales Manager would send me for sales training. If after 6 months in the field as a sales person I was not successful, or still did not like it, I could have my old job back as a Tech.

Not sure about today, but back in the late '80s when I first started working for them, Xerox sales training was considered the best in the world.

In 6 months, I was the 2nd revenue producer of Star Systems in all of Xerox. I made more money that I ever thought possible. I was hooked.

But, the least favorite part of my job was cold calling, which I did for 8-9 hours every Tuesday to set up demos and appointments for the rest of the week and into the next week. Lots and lots of phone work was involved. Sometimes once I finished one meeting, I'd look in the same office building for firms that may be able to use one of our Star Systems and would cold call in person. Again, hated doing that.

Over time, I didn't have any time for cold calling, however. I was just asking my customers for their introductions to other companies they thought might be a potential customer. Funny how lawyers and legal personnel all seem to know each other, regardless of the firms they worked for.

Parlayed that into a 10 year career with Xerox. Went onto become a Sales Manager, a Sales Training Manager (based in Leesburg, VA), a District Manager and finally the Director of Marketing for their (then new) color printers and copiers.

Since then I seem to have been in demand and have worked for companies small and large, with several startups during the (then) exploding tech arena in the '90s.

It all starts with cold calling, though.

If Craig @isellhondas is still around, he'll probably concur. So will @driver100.

The key is to have a clear upward path from the cold calling position. If successful, it can be very lucrative.

Good luck!

Home ownership should be no investment unless you have more than one. Your home is where you want to live....nothing more, nothing less. Whether prices go down or up, you need a place to live, that is what a home should be.


Some examples of why home investment can be bad....really bad;
1. Before we bought, we rented a townhouse in Florida. The people we rented it from bought it as an investment. Paid $650000 for it, used is $250000 pension money from Southwest as the down payment. They had to walk away when the value decreased to $250000 in 2008.
2. My brother rented his apartment 35 years ago......rent was $550 a month. Everyone told him to buy, and since then condo prices have probably tripled or quadrupled. But, because of rent controls he ended up paying $930 a month after 35 years. His rent didn't even double over that time....now who is the smart one?
3. Our place in Florida reached a peak of being worth about $220000 just before the crash of 2008. We bought it for $125000 in 2011. Original price 22 years ago was about $110000, Our home is worth maybe $160 to $170K, but I am not a financial genius, just bought at the right time....still, not a huge profit over 7 years, especially if you include costs to maintain, taxes, etc. It is buying a lifestyle....that is what it is....I don't consider it an investment at all. If it goes up great, it doesn't really matter.

Quite true, driver. Happily, the absence of a mortgage means one's ""rent"" is pretty darn cheap. If I include all my housing-related fixed expenses (property taxes and utilities), I'm at about $650 a month. For this area, that's equivalent to a 500 square-foot dry cabin off in some mosquito-infested swamp.
$400/month for me. I couldn't rent anything bigger than a backyard tool shed for that amount.

I got a dark single-bedroom apartment in dilapidated university housing community for $270/month in Tallahassee in 1998. The place was not very nice, but it was quite safe, even if surrounded by a sketchy neighborhood (university police patrolled the area regularly, so the ""neighbors"" would not venture in). Quite a bargain for a foreign student from a non-First World country. I lived there until I graduated in 2001.

There was a little mold here and there that had to be dealt with. Insects, too (the area was surrounded by old trees). I remember I was once attacked by an angry mob of fireants dropping from my AC unit above my bed. Fortunately after couple of bites I realized what was going on and took care of it. It was a great time.

Now I'm paying $270 per month just to cover my HOA.

I just looked at Zillo's rent vs buy calculator. According to them, renting is the best option if you are going to live in a place for 2 years or less. Buying is the better option if you plan of being there over 2 years. After 30 years the difference in favor of buying was astronomical.
They forgot to mention timing is a factor. If you bought at the peak in about 2006, you would still be underwater today in most areas. Our Florida place would have been worth $210k then, and $16 - $170k now. They never tell you those things, just use a chart with a long timeline.

Ok, consider me cautioned. However I am not suggesting that someone rush out and buy or sell stocks based on one tidbit of news. That would be very foolish. That said, the stock market is a very good gauge of whether current news is considered positive or negative and reacts very quickly. This news was greeted with an extremely positive response. This means the financial sector voted with their cash that they considered this to be very good news, which is at odds with some of the negative reactions here.

Don’t think I’m not checking here every day! LOL!

Regarding cars and tariffs, I’m thinking this is not going to end well for the consumer. Prices for cars we mostly know and love in this forum (BMW/Mercedes/VW/Volvo/Audi), all are going to become much less competitive price wise. Yes, I’m sure some of the tarrif will be absorbed by the manufacturers. But, there will be a significant amount that will be tacked on to the MSRP.

That’s not good for anyone.....not the manufacturers.....not the consumers. And, it’s likely to spur an already rising inflationary rate.

At best, it’s ominous. I see Honda, Toyota and Nissan perhaps picking up some market share. The U.S. manufacturers are all but abandoning cars for trucks, CUVs, SUVs.

Gas prices have been rising, too.

Then we have the roll back of banking oversight.

This all paints an ugly picture in the next 12-18-24 months. And, like what happened 10 years ago, it’s going to take a Herculean effort to get things back on track, again. The last time, it took 4-5 years for the previous administration to get things moving in the right direction, again.

I would caution against bringing 15-minute stock market ticks (up or down, doesn't matter) as justification for anything. And I mean absolutely ANYTHING. As a 10+ year investor (direct in stocks), I can assure you stock market is smart only in context of multiyear (5+) stretches - when it comes to minute-to-minute or even on occasion even month-to-month, it can be as dumb as a table. Also, if you start accepting stock market rising as a ""proof"", you will have to accept it falling, too.

3928,July 25,jmonroe,"A pretty interesting story:

I had to go to Home Depot today and Mrs. j wanted to tag along. Said something about wanting to look at a light fixture for the laundry room and since there is an Aldi's close by she wanted to get some milk and another thing or two. For those not familiar with Aldi's, it is a discount food store of sorts (not a club like Sam's and Costco) but it carries mostly their own brand of stuff. FWIW, awhile back CR rated it within the top 20 grocery stores in the country. One of the things about Aldi's is you have to insert a quarter into a gizmo on the shopping cart to release a chain from the cart in front of it so that you can get your cart. Then when you return your cart and insert the chain from the cart in front, your quarter is ejected. At first thought it sounds kinda petty but after thinking about it, this insures that almost everyone returns their carts which insures less runaway carts in the parking lot.

Today when I pulled in, I notice a very old pickup pulling into a space about 2 spaces over from me. This pickup looks like it is used on a farm and is beaten to hell and back. A woman jumps out and heads to the station where the carts are located and she gets there about 5 steps ahead of me. I see that she has what looks like a washer (it had a whole in the center of it like washers have) with small groves filed around the circumference of it. It pretty much looks likes a quarter except for the hole in the center of it. She's inserts it then pulls it out and inserts it again. Then she starts jiggling it around. All the while moaning that she can't get her cart. I said, ""I think you have to use a quarter"". She snaps back, ""I know that but this has worked before"". Then she reaches into her pocket and takes out another washer. That one didn't work either. She is now beside herself and says, ""they must have changed their carts or something because the last time, I had a hell of a time getting my washer back and one time it stole my washer altogether and I had to leave it in this thing"". Finally she reaches into her pocket and takes out a regulation quarter, inserts it (success) and dashes off quickly into the store. Mrs. j went ahead of me into the store and when I got to her I couldn't stop laughing. She wanted to know why so I told her the story. Wide eyed she said, ""what did she look like""? I described her and then she said, ""that's her over there and she's the one that almost ran me and this lady over (points to a woman across the aisle) running with her cart"".

If the washer, or even a slug, is the same dimension of a quarter it will work. In a pinch, when I was quarterless, I have used washers. Since it returns to you when you return the cart no harm no foul. Once when I did that as I was returning the cart someone wanted to grab it and give me the quarter he was going to use, I refused it explaining that I used a washer.

They built an Aldi's in my neighborhood about a year ago. It's the only competition to the local HEB, and I can't say that I care for it very much. Where I live there are a lot of people who don't have cars, and they tend to steal the shopping carts. Or at least ""borrow"" them to roll their groceries home. The HEB put the automatic locking brakes on their carts to slow down the practice. Aldi's as you mentioned requires a quarter, which isn't much. The other day, on one of the side streets, I spotted about 20 shopping carts. I slowed down for a better look, and it was a whole string of Aldi shopping carts all locked together. Someone just stole the whole string!

Yesterday I got a survey email from the local newspaper, the Dayton Daily Nothing, offering $500 if I am picked after filling out a survey. I assumed the survey would be about the poorly done newspaper and their bias problems. The paper has made it impossible to give comments on their articles so I thought this could be interesting. Instead The very beginning of the survey verified email address and next page was a full page of all kinds of demographic information, including race, income, and several other things stopping short of social security number and mother's maiden name. That was probably on the next page that I never saw because I cancelled out.

With all the exposures about how the Alphabets, Google & all, and Facebook have collected information and then released or sold it to favored customers, there's no way I'm giving personal info to the local failing daily paper.
BTW, I don't subscribe to the paper. I get an epaper access because a friend subscribes to the paper version and gets 5 email access copies to give away to friends.

When I was a little kid, my mom had a big 70s T-Bird, but for most of the time it was in the family, I think I was young enough to climb through/over the seats with little effort (as an aside, white leather might not be the best choice for a car hauling kids). It was eventually replaced with a Tempo sedan, she hasn't had a 2 door car since.

Since this is an auto forum, I'll go with the cars.... Wow. I'm finding it difficult to remember!

Let's see.... I think an early '70s Charger was the first one. I remember it was this fastback-looking beast with tall black vinyl bucket seats, exterior was sorta cat-poop brown and it had at least one fender that was primer only. That's the car in which I learned the value of a seatbelt (different story)!

My mother also had a pair of those Mitsubishi-made late 70s Dodge Challengers (one silver, one blue). Hahaha; my brother and I knocked one of them out of gear on a hill once and had a close call. Strangely enough, several years later my younger brother did the same thing and ended up taking out a neighbor's white picket fence with it, narrowly missing their parked cars.

And, then she had two Trans Ams: A 1979 and a 1984. Thankfully, the drive-in visits were over before either of those cars came into her possession.

You mean you didn't take him up on his offer to pave your driveway for a ridiculously low price.

As for bike speeds, I can see why they would include limits for machines that are not self-powered. However, I typically ride my bike at 20 mph or more on flats, and DEFINITELY far faster than that down hills. As long as I'm the one expending the effort, I'll go however fast I want.

Most states require that ebikes that can go faster than 20 MPH to be registered and licensed and the rider needing an endorsement on their license.

You're right. Same in OH. But, I think they skirt this by claiming it's delivered with a 20 MPH speed limit, but have ways of getting around the issue by limiting the speed with software. Once you find out how to ""undo"" the artificial limiter, you're off to the races.

But you know....skinny little tires, limited braking....20 mph on a bicycle is fast enough....you hit one little rock, or catch a groove in the road and you're in for it---as we say in the motorcycle world---""a few seconds on the Belt Sander of Life"".


No disagreement. I removed the software limiter on mine. Got it up to 35 MPH. At first it was a hoot. But, as you say, once you realize one blow out, one unexpected rock on the roadway, one pothole you didn't anticipate, and you're doing a not so graceful exit off the seat of the bike into blacktop, a telephone pole, a car, or Lord only knows what else.....at 35 MPH, with nothing but a flimsy helmet protecting you.

On downhill stretches bike racers can hit or even exceed 55 MPH. During the last Olympics bike races actually put ran the motorcycles that were recording the race on the down hill sections. I have approached 50 on a down hill sprint, that was a rush.




Nope...not doing that. Pretty cool to watch, though. Actually, the brakes on my bike a tons better than what I road as a kid. I have hydraulic disks, slotted rotors and dual piston calipers.

OK, here's my MPG test results for Mrs. j's 2012 Legacy with the 3.6R engine:

Went out to dinner last night. Round trip was 6.6 miles not the 7 I said it would be but 7 was a pretty good guess. MPG was 12.9 on trip computer ""A"". I set trip computer ""B"" at about 2.5 miles from home on the way back just for the fun of it. MPG was 17.6 , for trip computer ""B"" when we got home. The only way I can begin to explain this is that the car was cold (not driven all day until we went out to dinner last night) so by the time I was driving it home after dinner it was warmed up. Again, just a guess as to why the difference from 12.9 MPG (11 miles) to 17.6 MPG (about 2.5 miles).

Today we both had scheduled doctor's appointments with the same doctor. Round trip was 11.0 miles and the MPG was 17.4 (only used trip computer ""A""). Some of that was cold driving on initial start up but the rest was with the car fully warmed up. So, that 15 MPG that I mentioned in my post yesterday is probably about what that car gets on average for in town driving under all temperature conditions.

This morning when we got home, Mrs. j got out of the car first to get the mail. While I was still in the car recording numbers, she wanted to know what I was doing and I told her, ""hold on I'll explain this when we get in the house"". Once in the house I said, ""your car is a gas hog. Cars today get better gas mileage so maybe we should get you a new Legacy"". Well, that did it. She said, ""I knew I'd be sorry for saying that burgundy Subaru we were behind when we went out for dinner on our anniversary last week would come back to haunt me. And furthermore, even though I don't know anything about cars, I know enough that spending tens of thousands of dollars for a car to get a little better gas mileage is a dumb economic move"".

I think I lost that argument so now what do I do?

When I was kid my father almost always allowed me to have the car when I wanted it because he knew I was a better driver than most kids.

You can hear the Grand 'Ol Opry in Nashville Tennessee
It's the home of country music, on that we all agree
But when you cross that 'Ol Red River Hoss, that just don't mean a thing
Cause when you're down in Texas, Bob Wills is still the King....

I've never been to a drive-in movie. Why would you want to be in the backseat to watch a movie?
If you are talking teen years, usually you wanted to be in the back seat because there was more action going on there than on the screen.

If you mean pre-teen years.............parents usually stayed in the front, kids in the back, but you could still see the movie....kids can easily stand in the back.

Nope...not doing that. Pretty cool to watch, though. Actually, the brakes on my bike a tons better than what I road as a kid. I have hydraulic disks, slotted rotors and dual piston calipers.

This, vs a small piece of rubber rubbing on a steel rim to slow me down when I was younger. Or, even worse, coaster brakes.
I imagine those new-fangled disc brakes are fantastic! I've never ridden a bike that had anything better than the rubber compression brake. However, the center-pull version of that is so much nicer than the old style clamp version.

In the old days if you were in the back you could see fairly well with bench seats and no headrests. In a lot of todays cars the front seats are pretty tall....anyone in the back just has a small area between the seats to try to see a movie screen.
My parents always had those coupes with tall one-piece bucket seats. I either had to stand up and hang onto the back of the seat to peer around, or try to look between them. Glancing up front that way is okay, but trying to watch a whole movie? Not so much...!

My experience growing up with those annoying machines (four-seat coupes) was enough to swear me off them for life. I have more respect for my children than to torture them that way (I choose OTHER ways of torturing them! ).

The machines, or the methods of torture?

Since this is an auto forum, I'll go with the cars.... Wow. I'm finding it difficult to remember!

Let's see.... I think an early '70s Charger was the first one. I remember it was this fastback-looking beast with tall black vinyl bucket seats, exterior was sorta cat-poop brown and it had at least one fender that was primer only. That's the car in which I learned the value of a seatbelt (different story)!

My mother also had a pair of those Mitsubishi-made late 70s Dodge Challengers (one silver, one blue). Hahaha; my brother and I knocked one of them out of gear on a hill once and had a close call. Strangely enough, several years later my younger brother did the same thing and ended up taking out a neighbor's white picket fence with it, narrowly missing their parked cars.

And, then she had two Trans Ams: A 1979 and a 1984. Thankfully, the drive-in visits were over before either of those cars came into her possession.

Later, she also had a 1992 Plymouth Sundance, a 1973 K5 Blazer, and a 1974 Pinto station wagon. Seriously, EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM was a two-door! I swear, the woman loved to torture us (this was probably the mildest form of her tortures). However, she's a much better grandmother than she ever was a mother. She even has four-door cars now.

My FLX bike will do better than 30 MPH. It has a limiter on it. The company ""hinted"" that I should contact them for a ""surprise"" after I bought it. It was then I was told it had a limiter. They told me how to remove the limiter (really easy as it's an electric limiter and not mechanical). I've had my bike up to 45 MPH, but that was on a slight downhill.

Of course, the faster you go, the more power you use. Allegedly, I'm supposed to go 40 miles on a single charge. I've never tempted that and usually go no more than 30-35 miles between charges. That's with the limiter on, though.



Meeting your end at the hands of a distracted driver isn't the only negative result possible. You could be injured. As someone who broke a bone last year, let me tell you, injuries suck. And, at our age, you might not heal back to 100%. Talk about diminished value! That's diminished human value! Luckily, I don't play professional sports and make a living with my physical value. I'd say my arm is back to 95% though; not bad.

That's good mileage for a truck that was probably pretty well loaded. I might get that with my '15 Genny V8. The thing I will never understand is how I repeatedly got 32 MPG with my '95 Bonneville with the 3800 V6 engine with the A/C on and cruise set to around 65 MPH when I drove back and forth from SC to the Burgh. Even though these drives were limited to only interstate driving, I still think that is very good. I haven't gotten close to that mileage since. I can understand V8's not getting good mileage but even Mrs. j's 2012 Legacy with the 6 cylinder 3.6R engine can't get good mileage. I'll admit I haven't taken the Subie on any trips but putting around town it only gets about 15 MPG.

Hey @venture, what are you getting with your Subie 6 cylinder? Now that I'm asking this, if it is good, I could use that to convince Mrs. j to let me trade in her gas hog. Heck, even if you make up a good number I'll use it as ammo. Don't let me down.

It looked like they used quality bicycle components. I dunno; the one I would want is not available (expected September some time), so maybe I should just bite the bullet and give it a shot with their ""zero percent 12-month financing."" ~$175 a month for a year with no interest? I'm not sure I could go wrong on that. I just wouldn't get to use it until April 2019.
Gotta say the company has been a pleasure to work with. Some of those Kickstarter campaigns are a study in how to frustrate your customer, if they deliver what they promised at all. Not these guys. They hit all of their production and delivery targets. When mine arrived, while mostly assembled, there were some things that needed to be installed (seat, computer, wheels, etc.). They sent good instructions, but some things needed more clarification. They were all over it helping me. They even sent some extra bolts gratis as I had stripped one of them.

FLX is now up and running and profitable. They’re expanding into other (electric) products. Seems they regularly sell out of some models as a result.

If you don’t mind waiting, I highly recommend them. But, I’ve also heard good things about RAD bikes. So, there are some good choices out there.

I know what you mean but I was usually in the front seat because I was the driver. One time when I was with my best friend and his long time girl friend who were in the back seat, when I looked in the rear view mirror I didn't see any heads and I started to laugh. My girl friend for quite some time asked, ""what's so funny, this movie isn't a comedy. Someone just got shot""? I just turned the rear view mirror so she could see back there. Then she laughed too. Without turning around I yelled out, ""what are you guys doing back there"". In unison two heads popped up and they both said, ""NOTHING"". That's when I said, ""then get the hell outta there and let someone back there that knows what to do"". My girl friend quickly said, ""stay where you are.

Ah youth, when no speed is too much. I have fond memories of flying my bicycle down the big hill to the ice cream store no hands style to get a sundae. Passing cars on the right without a care in the world. I might have been doing 35 but it felt like 100. Thanks to the angels I never fell off.

4043,July 24,jmonroe,"OK, here's my MPG test results for Mrs. j's 2012 Legacy with the 3.6R engine:

Went out to dinner last night. Round trip was 6.6 miles not the 7 I said it would be but 7 was a pretty good guess. MPG was 12.9 on trip computer ""A"". I set trip computer ""B"" at about 2.5 miles from home on the way back just for the fun of it. MPG was 17.6 , for trip computer ""B"" when we got home. The only way I can begin to explain this is that the car was cold (not driven all day until we went out to dinner last night) so by the time I was driving it home after dinner it was warmed up. Again, just a guess as to why the difference from 12.9 MPG (11 miles) to 17.6 MPG (about 2.5 miles).

Today we both had scheduled doctor's appointments with the same doctor. Round trip was 11.0 miles and the MPG was 17.4 (only used trip computer ""A""). Some of that was cold driving on initial start up but the rest was with the car fully warmed up. So, that 15 MPG that I mentioned in my post yesterday is probably about what that car gets on average for in town driving under all temperature conditions.

This morning when we got home, Mrs. j got out of the car first to get the mail. While I was still in the car recording numbers, she wanted to know what I was doing and I told her, ""hold on I'll explain this when we get in the house"". Once in the house I said, ""your car is a gas hog. Cars today get better gas mileage so maybe we should get you a new Legacy"". Well, that did it. She said, ""I knew I'd be sorry for saying that burgundy Subaru we were behind when we went out for dinner on our anniversary last week would come back to haunt me. And furthermore, even though I don't know anything about cars, I know enough that spending tens of thousands of dollars for a car to get a little better gas mileage is a dumb economic move"".

My 12-mile hilly commute just takes too much out of me to do round-trip every day, and coordinating vehicle/bike locations so as not to need to make special trips to accommodate me proves overly complicated much of the time.
I like my bike. I ride it every weekend. If I have to pick up prescriptions at Walgreens (about 3 miles away, or go to the post office (about 5 miles away), I hop on the bike. I have a hilly connecting road to my cul-de-sac. On a regular bike, after riding a mile or so, I was winded since the hills are pretty steep. With my FLX, I don't have to peddle at all. But, I usually do give a slight pedal while using the electric motor.

Sometimes I don't peddle at all and and just a rider using the throttle to control my speed.

If I had a 10 mile commute, I'd be tempted to use it daily for that. But, my office is in my home (about 5 feet from my bedroom).

I haven't really had to do much for maintenance. I've oiled the chain a couple of times (it's a 9-speed). It really didn't need it though. I keep an eye on the tires to make sure I'm not picking up anything that would pierce them.

In traffic, I've surprised more than a few people in cars next to me on the road. On take off, given these things have instantaneous torque, I can get up to 20 MPH ""right now"".

It's just a fun bike.

However, I do like some of those electric motorcycles. Those climb up the price ladder pretty quickly to rival their petrol counterparts.

28FF....I like those RAD bikes a lot, too. Only reason I went with the FLX, I was able to buy one for less than $1,000 during their kickstarter campaign. They've grown quite a bit since then. They now have 3 bike models and are now making hover boards, too.

Great survival rate.  Now for my post since I kept with the “car” theme.

Beginning in May of this year, I have contacted and moaned and groaned and called the delivery and subscription department of my local newspaper to report that my newspaper has been delivered 1-2 hours later than their guaranteed delivery time of 6:30 AM on weekdays and 7:30 AM on weekends. Furthermore, on at least a dozen occasions in the past 3 months I got NO newspaper delivered.  Every time I call, I get a customer service rep who, in a very noticeable foreign accent, assures me they have escalated the problems to “upper management” and have notified the distributor of the problem and further assured me I would receive a phone call from the distributor to assist me in solving this persistent delivery issue (no pun intended!).  I have never, ever received a phone call from anyone in all these months and my problems reached a denouement (look the word up guys) with no paper delivered Saturday, Sunday and this morning.  I was at the end of my rope.  My usual phone calls to the paper’s subcontractor that handles deliveries and subscriptions were even more frustrating with promises I would get a call from the delivery contractor.

After many attempts, I called the newsroom of the Ft. Lauderdale paper and asked for help.  I was transferred to a consumer service manager.  She spoke to me in a beautiful Brooklyn accent and I complimented her on her outstanding oral communication skills - she laughed so I knew I was talking to the right person.

After looking up my subscription on her computer and reading all the referrals sent to “upper management” (she laughed at the term UPPER MANAGEMENT) she said, “...and after 26 requests to the delivery and subscription department you mean to tell me no one ever called you to respond to your phone calls and your delivery problems have not been solved?”  I responded in the affirmative.  She first told me that it was obvious the delivery subcontractor did not want to talk to me or he would have called me.  Secondly, she said that talking to the delivery and subscription department, which is located in THE PHILIPPINES, is not solving the problem because all they do is email the distributor- they can’t call him from the Far Western Pacific Ocean area.

She promised to resolve this and said she would call me tomorrow afternoon to report her findings.  Her son went to Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan as well as NYU (like me) and said she will get to the bottom of this fiasco as the mother of an alum.

So, now we shall see what happens.  All I can say is thank God for immigrants from New York - they get down to business!

That's good mileage for a truck that was probably pretty well loaded. I might get that with my '15 Genny V8.

I could just treat that one myself. The Recaro seats fit front two riders like a glove. The family Sentra S or the fast hatchback in Tangerine Scream? Both 6-speed sticks - the ghastly mileage would favor the Sentra S by about 5 mpg I would guess.

I am a fan of Woods because of his accomplishments.  Spieth, Thomas, McElroy, and Fowler along with about 8-9 other twenty-somethings are the future of golf.  Before Woods, I rarely watched golf on TV.  Now, I watch it all the time.  

Drives off the tee used to be 275-290 yards - now 320-350 yards is quite common.  This younger generation of pro golfers concentrate on physical fitness and work out in the gym every chance they get along with their personal trainers.  They use computer programs and cameras to evaluate their swings.  They are technicians with an army of specialists coaching them on every motion.  They are phenoms - but are superior in their game because of the technology, training and physical fitness which serve to expand their God-given skills and talents.

Woods grabbed the attention of the world because of his talent and the twenty-somethings have rekindled that attention to make golf a great spectator sport.  I can’t play golf very well, but I love watching these guys play and am awed by their talents.

Some of us used to be important where we work(ed), some still are and others think they were or are. Keep the stories and responses coming. Each of us views them differently, but they're interesting for sure.

I've pretty much given up on retaining any self-respect, given the large corporate nature of where I work, but it's always interesting to see how the titans of industry or civil service on here see things.
You don't have to be a Titan to have drama at work. The last few years before retirement a new boss took over and immeadiately began causing turmoil with staff. I had a run in with him in 2015 and nearly resigned then. As it was I decided to retire a year early just to be rid of him in 2017. In the year since I've had a few moments where I had second thoughts and considered that maybe I had overreacted and made a bad choice.

Then yesterday one of my old work associated stopped by to tell me that partially due to this boss's overbearing attitude and mind games two bus driver's had hung themselves in the year since I left.

I no longer have any second thoughts. Life is too short.

Hope you guys will indulge me for a bit, but we’re all friends here, right?

For a little over a month, there’s been this lady trying to connect with me on Linked IN. For those of you not familiar with Linked In, it’s a business web site that allows other business people to connect with you.

Anyway, I usually turn down requests to connect to people that I don’t have at least a passing interest that aligns with my business (tech). She was persistent, so I connected with her. Next think I know, she’s emailing me wanting to talk about how our companies can work together. I hope I’m humble, but my company has a long history in the tech field (as long as HP, INTEL, etc). We have ~$5B in annual revenues. If there’s something we don’t know how to do in our field (which ain’t much), we sometimes listen to outside sources for some tech we can synch with. But, we don’t normally buy what we can create.

I explained all this to her.

She was persistent, to the point where she contacted my boss stating she just wanted to talk, but I was being dismissive (I wasn’t very interested, but far from dismissive....I listened to her intently).

My boss, wanting to push her off his plate back onto mine, states I should have one meeting with her. If it isn’t worth our time by my estimation, he said he’d consider the issue dead.

Well, her office is in CA, so maybe it won’t be too bad. But, she can only meet today (Friday) before she jets off to somewhere in Europe. Not wanting this to linger, I flew to CA today to meet. Took an early flight that got me in to LA just before noon for a luncheon.

I land and turn on my phone to hear a voice mail from her stating something came up and she couldn’t make lunch, but could meet mid afternoon. I’m not feeling good about this.

She wants to meet at her office which is above a florist shop in Westwood. But this isn’t in an area that speaks to me how she’s successful.

We meet. She’s 26, newly minted Harvard grad (so she says). She immediately went into how she just closed $20M in funding (so she says) to develop an app that has little, if anything, that would interest us.

I politely dig a little to see why she thinks we would be interested and why she contacted me. Somehow or another, she knows someone I know on Linked in. Followed his contacts and got to me. Long and short of this, she’s calling as many people she can, to try to drum up money.

Perturbed, I let her know, nicely but firmly that this was a collassal waste of my time. I felt she was deceptive. And it cost my company a $500 flight, a day of my time, $50 in food, $20 parking.

Huffily, She reminded me of her Harvard grad status and that she had $20M in the bank (neither of which passes the smell test). Not saying another word, I left. Got an Uber.

Looks like the tire hit right at the seam between the roof and side frame. I bet it would still survive a rollover. I doubt most SUVs would have reacted differently if hit at that same point. Vehicles aren't designed with tire hits in mind unless the government mandates it.

Once we had a great house in the country.....the living room was a 150 year old log farmhouse, and the modern house was built around that. We sold it and we had to go there one day to deliver something.

Ain't that the truth. I was thinking the same thing.

Sexual harassment has always been something you had to be aware of but it is out of control today. It has gotten to the point that I sometimes think the only reason some people go to work is to see how much trouble they can create.

Here is a little story from my past that, if this was today, I'm not so sure I would have done this but I did know who I was talking with.

Back in the late 70's before I was coerced into management our group secretary, who had been recently divorced less than a year because of an unfaithful husband, came to me one day because she knew I dabbled with home maintenance and wanted some advice since she wanted to save the cost of hiring a plumber. She had come to me several times before and she was getting pretty good with things around the house from what she was telling me over the past several months. But now she wanted to know how to remove and replace a shut off valve in her basement that led to the outside hose bib. It was leaking and wouldn't shut off the water to the bib. She had already found that the screw that held the washer in place was corroded and could not be removed so that she could just replace the washer. Fall was coming and she knew she had to shut off the water so that the bib didn't freeze with winter coming. The bib was not leaking, only the shut off capability of the inside shut off valve which was about a foot from the basement concrete block wall and was connected with copper tubing. Like I said, she was getting pretty good at things around the house and knew what had to be done. OK, that's the lead-in to the story which I will tell via my conversation method:

She comes into my cube one morning and said.

Her: Hey jmonroe, I want you to tell me how to sweat.

Me: Run around the building a couple times at lunch time. That otta do it.

Her: No damn it, I'm serious.

That is when she told me what she wanted to do.

Me: I could tell you but it probably won't help you very much because that is something you have to see done a few times before you try it yourself.

Just as I'm about to tell her I can come over and do it, she said.

Her: I sorta thought that, so maybe I should take up my neighbors offer to do it. He said he's done it a couple times and has been successful sweating copper tubing but I didn't want to bother him.

Me: As long as you're confident that he can help, that might not be a bad idea.

Her: I might as well since I really can't afford a plumber right now.

I guess this is the time to say she is about my age, pretty attractive with 2 kids about my kids age. So, to have some fun I say.

Me: Are you sure he just wants to be helpful and doesn't want something else.

She is still sensitive about her divorce and says in an irritated voice.

Her: DAMN IT JMONROE, IS THAT ALL YOU GUYS EVER THINK ABOUT?

Not wanting to sound like she has intimidated me I pause to calm myself and say.

Me: Ah, ahhh...no, but it beats the hell out of everything that's in second place.

No harm done because I knew who I was talking to. FWIW, she had her neighbor replace the valve and she told me she could not have done it herself with just verbal instructions but now that she saw it done, she thinks she could do it herself. However, I never heard her say she ever did it, so not sure about that.

Again, you have to know who you are talking to.

OK, you got me monroe. Start off with something interesting, me thinking you might have been compromised, and then on to a very dull, drab, ending. You're getting good at this. Fooled me into reading a long post !!

Thanks for letting me vent, guys.

@bwia ....funny you should mention that. I emailed my trip report to my boss yesterday (along with my expense report for the trip). He emailed his reply which is almost the same as your assessment. He said not to be surprised if she asks for an intro to the hiring manager at my company, or to offer another “meet and greet” to try and recruit me.

I told her that there were holes in her business plan. A VC or angel investor would have probably picked up on that if I was able to, as I’m not a person who deals in business plans on a daily basis.

Funny, I got an email from her yesterday asking me to sign an NDA....AFTER THE FACT!. I’m not allowed to sign NDAs without passing it through my legal dept, which usually takes months, and certainly don’t come out in tact.

That’s just bad business...sharing your company business plans and tech without having an NDA in place....BEFORE HAND!

Then here is a money saving tip, just buy a jar of olives.

Here is my ultimate martini recipe, take gin and vermouth and pour them down the drain where they belong and pour yourself a whiskey.
Won’t work for me snake.  The olives need to rest in the martini for at least 10 minutes in order to absorb some of the alcohol - otherwise they taste just like olives out of the jar.

Hope you guys will indulge me for a bit, but we’re all friends here, right?

For a little over a month, there’s been this lady trying to connect with me on Linked IN. For those of you not familiar with Linked In, it’s a business web site that allows other business people to connect with you.

Anyway, I usually turn down requests to connect to people that I don’t have at least a passing interest that aligns with my business (tech). She was persistent, so I connected with her. Next think I know, she’s emailing me wanting to talk about how our companies can work together. I hope I’m humble, but my company has a long history in the tech field (as long as HP, INTEL, etc). We have ~$5B in annual revenues. If there’s something we don’t know how to do in our field (which ain’t much), we sometimes listen to outside sources for some tech we can synch with. But, we don’t normally buy what we can create.

I explained all this to her.

She was persistent, to the point where she contacted my boss stating she just wanted to talk, but I was being dismissive (I wasn’t very interested, but far from dismissive....I listened to her intently).

My boss, wanting to push her off his plate back onto mine, states I should have one meeting with her. If it isn’t worth our time by my estimation, he said he’d consider the issue dead.

Well, her office is in CA, so maybe it won’t be too bad. But, she can only meet today (Friday) before she jets off to somewhere in Europe. Not wanting this to linger, I flew to CA today to meet. Took an early flight that got me in to LA just before noon for a luncheon.

I land and turn on my phone to hear a voice mail from her stating something came up and she couldn’t make lunch, but could meet mid afternoon. I’m not feeling good about this.

She wants to meet at her office which is above a florist shop in Westwood. But this isn’t in an area that speaks to me how she’s successful.

We meet. She’s 26, newly minted Harvard grad (so she says). She immediately went into how she just closed $20M in funding (so she says) to develop an app that has little, if anything, that would interest us.

I politely dig a little to see why she thinks we would be interested and why she contacted me. Somehow or another, she knows someone I know on Linked in. Followed his contacts and got to me. Long and short of this, she’s calling as many people she can, to try to drum up money.

Perturbed, I let her know, nicely but firmly that this was a collassal waste of my time. I felt she was deceptive. And it cost my company a $500 flight, a day of my time, $50 in food, $20 parking.

Huffily, She reminded me of her Harvard grad status and that she had $20M in the bank (neither of which passes the smell test). Not saying another word, I left. Got an Uber.

I just got to the airport, only to find out my flight home is cancelled
And 11 p.m. is the next flight out, which means it’s a red-eye.

I’m livid!

So frustrating, and so glad I don't have to deal with that any more.
I’m pretty lucky now. My four in field are all excellent, hard workers. My two directs inside are also pretty good. I’ve got one more (who doesn’t directly report to me) who had a rough time with the transition to her new leadership and was on thin ice for awhile. We were able to work through the rough patch, switch up her duties a bit (some clerical for me) and she is like a whole new team member.

Well, I was a proponent of MBWA (management by walking around).  My secretaries disliked this approach to managing a large school because I was rarely in my office.  So when important phone calls came in from the Superintendent’s office or Asst. Superintendent’s office, they were always taking messages or explaining I was unavailable because I was visiting classrooms, which I did every day.  That kept staff on their toes - they never knew when I would stop into their classroom and observe instruction.

Finally, Central office (supt.’s offices) got me a pager so I was notified of an urgent call or situation somewhere in the building.  Hated that pager - but that’s what they required for an exceedingly ambulatory administrator.

I need to research this more in terms of taxes, property values, etc. Honestly, I don't see myself fitting in down south. I'm too independent-minded....

My boss is great. He really is. He’s smart. He’s fair. If he believes in you, he’ll go to bat for you. I’ve worked for him for over 20 years. If he changes positions or companies, he usually drags me with him with a nice pay bump as a reward.

After all these years, sometimes we don’t agree. This is one of those cases. I explained to him what I thought. He believed there might be something we could perhaps license from this lady and her company. He just asked that I go into the meeting with an open mind.

Not sure I did that, but I gave her the opportunity to make her case. She wanted to try to bully me (who has twice the experience than she has age). That wasn’t the correct way to do that.

I wrote the report of the trip on the plane last night while flying home. I assessed that the concept wasn’t a bad one. It’s nowhere near our focus, though. I wrote that IF her claim of $20M in funding is true (which she failed to provide proof of after repeated requests to do so), and given what I guesstimate the current run rate of salary and expenses (she says she has 20 employees, even though I only counted 7) her funding runway will end somewhere around 2021.

She probably needs more $$$$ to complete her project and was turned down by the funding community. And, is now looking to the tech companies (I doubt I was the only one she contacted) to continue funding.

She has interest from some companies (again hard to quantify), but no significant revenue to speak of. She does show some revenue from some mid-level companies, but it’s not very much and not repeatable.

We look at these types of companies all the time....startups who have complementary technology and need investment or want to sign a licensing agreement from us. I don’t usually get involved with this type of activity. But, I’m called in from time to time to assess the possible potential.

She’s pretty slick gathering tech contacts. If she was funded, she would have proudly announced who her partners were. Couldn’t get that info from her.

I don’t think my boss knew of any of this. All her heard was she had some interesting tech (after a brief elevator pitch) and wanted to engage us about it.

I’ve probably heard a dozen pitches from outside of the company. Only one was worthwhile and we did invest some money (not millions, though). The rest either weren’t viable, were not managed well, or like this case, not aligned with what we do as a company.

Ain't that the truth. I was thinking the same thing.

Sexual harassment has always been something you had to be aware of but it is out of control today. It has gotten to the point that I sometimes think the only reason some people go to work is to see how much trouble they can create.

Here is a little story from my past that, if this was today, I'm not so sure I would have done this but I did know who I was talking with.

Back in the late 70's before I was coerced into management our group secretary, who had been recently divorced less than a year because of an unfaithful husband, came to me one day because she knew I dabbled with home maintenance and wanted some advice since she wanted to save the cost of hiring a plumber. She had come to me several times before and she was getting pretty good with things around the house from what she was telling me over the past several months. But now she wanted to know how to remove and replace a shut off valve in her basement that led to the outside hose bib. It was leaking and wouldn't shut off the water to the bib. She had already found that the screw that held the washer in place was corroded and could not be removed so that she could just replace the washer. Fall was coming and she knew she had to shut off the water so that the bib didn't freeze with winter coming. The bib was not leaking, only the shut off capability of the inside shut off valve which was about a foot from the basement concrete block wall and was connected with copper tubing. Like I said, she was getting pretty good at things around the house and knew what had to be done. OK, that's the lead-in to the story which I will tell via my conversation method:

She comes into my cube one morning and said.

Her: Hey jmonroe, I want you to tell me how to sweat.

Me: Run around the building a couple times at lunch time. That otta do it.

Her: No damn it, I'm serious.

That is when she told me what she wanted to do.

Me: I could tell you but it probably won't help you very much because that is something you have to see done a few times before you try it yourself.

Just as I'm about to tell her I can come over and do it, she said.

Her: I sorta thought that, so maybe I should take up my neighbors offer to do it. He said he's done it a couple times and has been successful sweating copper tubing but I didn't want to bother him.

Me: As long as you're confident that he can help, that might not be a bad idea.

Her: I might as well since I really can't afford a plumber right now.

I guess this is the time to say she is about my age, pretty attractive with 2 kids about my kids age. So, to have some fun I say.

Me: Are you sure he just wants to be helpful and doesn't want something else.

She is still sensitive about her divorce and says in an irritated voice.

Her: DAMN IT JMONROE, IS THAT ALL YOU GUYS EVER THINK ABOUT?

Not wanting to sound like she has intimidated me I pause to calm myself and say.

Me: Ah, ahhh...no, but it beats the hell out of everything that's in second place.

No harm done because I knew who I was talking to. FWIW, she had her neighbor replace the valve and she told me she could not have done it herself with just verbal instructions but now that she saw it done, she thinks she could do it herself. However, I never heard her say she ever did it, so not sure about that.

Again, you have to know who you are talking to.

@Snake, I remember seeing a show on TV years ago where they were rating hot dogs across the country. They went to a famous hot dog place in Chicago that had a Neon sign hot dog on the roof of the building. I can't remember the name of the place (again) even though you posted a pic of the place when we last critiqued hot dogs in here.

The part I liked best is when they interviewed the elderly couple that owned the place and they said they refuse to apply ketchup to their hot dogs. If the customer wanted ketchup, they would provide ketchup packs but they would not deface their hot dogs by applying it themselves and I agree with them. There otta be a law about doing that to hot dogs.

It might have been Superdawg, there are a multiple number of explanations why no ketchup but it is verboten in chicago. Some places won't even stock ketchup for people to apply it themselves. No true Chicagoan will admit to using it even if they do.

I'm strictly an android man myself, I won't touch anything Apple. Which all stems from a cuss fight I had with Steve Jobs more than 30 years ago. Yes, I am the sort to hold a grudge.
The Jobs story is one I’d like to hear.

The Jobs story is one I’d like to hear.
In the early days of the IBM PC and the clones thereof, device drivers were rather hard to come by. They had to be written in 8086 assembly language, and almost no one spoke that. I taught myself 8086 assembler by studying the source code for the IBM PC BIOS (which IBM had published), just so I could write a device driver for something that I wanted to connect to my clone PC.

This was before the internet, but we did have BBS (Bulletin Board Systems), which talked to each other and passed things around. I released that device driver, and then did a couple more by request. Next thing you know, Microsoft contacts me, wants me to fly up and interview. They were trying to get one of the very early versions of Windows off the ground, and one thing they needed very badly were device drivers.

I interviewed, but didn’t take their job offer. Looking back, I really should have, I would have become rich off the stock options. Hindsight is always 20/20. Apple of course had spies at Microsoft, and they contacted me and asked me to interview with them, which I did. During the course of my interview at Apple, they took me in to meet Steve Jobs. We got into a discussion of the Motorola 68020 versus the Intel 80386 microprocessor.

Steve Jobs was the type of person, whatever he was doing, whatever he was using, was automatically better than the rest. I admitted that I liked the flat memory model of the Motorola, but really preferred the Intel. When you’re trying to write assembly language, a complex instruction set (CISC) is so much easier to work with than a reduced instruction set (RISC).

To make a long story short, he really didn’t care for me disagreeing with him, called me an “ignorant ___”, so I responded in kind, and things got bad in a hurry. The guy who was walking me around the place hustled me out, took me straight to the airport. Warned me that Steve Jobs might very well cancel my return ticket (which he didn’t, thank goodness).

@Snake, I remember seeing a show on TV years ago where they were rating hot dogs across the country. They went to a famous hot dog place in Chicago that had a Neon sign hot dog on the roof of the building. I can't remember the name of the place (again) even though you posted a pic of the place when we last critiqued hot dogs in here. The part I liked best is when they interviewed the elderly couple that owned the place and they said they refuse to apply ketchup to their hot dogs. If the customer wanted ketchup, they would provide ketchup packs but they would not deface their hot dogs by applying it themselves and I agree with them. There otta be a law about doing that to hot dogs. jmonroe
It might have been Superdawg, there are a multiple number of explanations why no ketchup but it is verboten in chicago. Some places won't even stock ketchup for people to apply it themselves. No true Chicagoan will admit to using it even if they do.

She may have recourse in the courts against a shop who put on the wheel improperly or a friend who put the wheel back on the van , but isn't it ultimately she who bears the responsibility for not maintaining a safe vehicle? And that wheel had to have loosened and have been giving symptoms before it came off. She should have slowed and gotten off the road to find out what was causing the vibration.

Assignment complete. Please send my plastic trophy for participation! LOL
Without finding some lug nuts or lug nuts still attached to the rotor studs that snapped off, it's going to be pretty hard to determine what happened. Kinda like what came first, the chicken or the egg. I'm sure they found the wheel and maybe a stress expert can determine from that what happened upon examination. Like examining the wear pattern around the holes in the wheel but again pretty tough to pin down, IMO. And to complicate this, it could have been a combination of a lug nut or two coming off which imposed added stress on the remaining studs which caused them to snap.

As for getting a trophy, we don't give trophies for incomplete assignments here at Edmunds. Read the bylaws.

I would think the van owner would be directly responsible since it was her car that caused the death. She in turn could sue the shop (assuming there was one) to recover damages due to poor work.

For a little over a month, there’s been this lady trying to connect with me on Linked IN. For those of you not familiar with Linked In, it’s a business web site that allows other business people to connect with you.

Anyway, I usually turn down requests to connect to people that I don’t have at least a passing interest that aligns with my business (tech). She was persistent, so I connected with her. Next think I know, she’s emailing me wanting to talk about how our companies can work together. I hope I’m humble, but my company has a long history in the tech field (as long as HP, INTEL, etc). We have ~$5B in annual revenues. If there’s something we don’t know how to do in our field (which ain’t much), we sometimes listen to outside sources for some tech we can synch with. But, we don’t normally buy what we can create.

I explained all this to her.

She was persistent, to the point where she contacted my boss stating she just wanted to talk, but I was being dismissive (I wasn’t very interested, but far from dismissive....I listened to her intently).

My boss, wanting to push her off his plate back onto mine, states I should have one meeting with her. If it isn’t worth our time by my estimation, he said he’d consider the issue dead.

Well, her office is in CA, so maybe it won’t be too bad. But, she can only meet today (Friday) before she jets off to somewhere in Europe. Not wanting this to linger, I flew to CA today to meet. Took an early flight that got me in to LA just before noon for a luncheon.

I land and turn on my phone to hear a voice mail from her stating something came up and she couldn’t make lunch, but could meet mid afternoon. I’m not feeling good about this.

She wants to meet at her office which is above a florist shop in Westwood. But this isn’t in an area that speaks to me how she’s successful.

We meet. She’s 26, newly minted Harvard grad (so she says). She immediately went into how she just closed $20M in funding (so she says) to develop an app that has little, if anything, that would interest us.

I politely dig a little to see why she thinks we would be interested and why she contacted me. Somehow or another, she knows someone I know on Linked in. Followed his contacts and got to me. Long and short of this, she’s calling as many people she can, to try to drum up money.

Perturbed, I let her know, nicely but firmly that this was a collassal waste of my time. I felt she was deceptive. And it cost my company a $500 flight, a day of my time, $50 in food, $20 parking.

Huffily, She reminded me of her Harvard grad status and that she had $20M in the bank (neither of which passes the smell test). Not saying another word, I left. Got an Uber.

I just got to the airport, only to find out my flight home is cancelled
And 11 p.m. is the next flight out, which means it’s a red-eye.

Yeah but I have found that the one critical of them are not exactly the most unbiased groups they are pushing agendas.

The one I really liked is when they put red light cameras at some intersections in my town there was a group staring that at one intersection accidents increased by 300% in the 6 months after installation as opposed to the 6 months prior. The problems with their stats was that the number of accidents went from 1 to 3 and that the 1 happened in the summer months and the 3 happened in the snowy winter months. When you compared the year prior to the year after there were less accidents. 

How many more accidents in the year, one? And you should ask yourself why an intersection with one accident all summer long needs cameras in the first place!

@Snake, I remember seeing a show on TV years ago where they were rating hot dogs across the country. They went to a famous hot dog place in Chicago that had a Neon sign hot dog on the roof of the building. I can't remember the name of the place (again) even though you posted a pic of the place when we last critiqued hot dogs in here.

I feel the same way about ketchup. Also onions which I know many people like but which is inexplicable to me. On the rare occasion that I have a hot dog (much more likely to go for a brat or an Italian sausage) it gets mustard, green pickle relish, and sauerkraut.

In the video it shows the minivan (Chrysler corp) on flatbed. The studs are all gone on the left front wheel. When loose lug nuts cause the wheel to come off, do all the studs get broken down below the face of the brake rotor?

My question that I wanted to ask earlier in my first post, was is the driver of the minivan responsible for the damage from the separated wheel. She may have recourse in the courts against a shop who put on the wheel improperly or a friend who put the wheel back on the van , but isn't it ultimately she who bears the responsibility for not maintaining a safe vehicle? And that wheel had to have loosened and have been giving symptoms before it came off. She should have slowed and gotten off the road to find out what was causing the vibration.

Curiously, news reports have said little about the 21-year old driver. I wonder if she's politically connected...?

The real problem with tariffs is they enable the domestic suppliers to raise their prices to be just below the foreign supplier price with the tariff attached. That is already happening in the steel industry. Domestic autos will be that way also. Lessening competition has never helped consumers.
Tariffs are based on the very false premise that the country with the largest surplus wins.

A few years ago I was cruising down a back country road when I ran into a recently finished roundabout. The trouble was that this was smack dab in the middle of corn fields, very light traffic and no cross street. It took them almost three years to build the crossroad and no one uses that road. That new road goes nowhere and comes from nowhere. 
Hahaha; planning for the future? The last time I drove through ""corn fields"" to avoid Chicago, we ended up driving through many McMansion areas that, only a few years before, really had been just corn fields. Lots of traffic on overloaded little two-lane ""back country"" roads... took forever. I told my wife that we're going to need to recalibrate what we call ""driving around Chicago"" the next time we do that.

Reminds me of my commute from South Jersey to King of Prussia (suburb of Philly). It was about 30 miles, 90 mins was common with two hours on a Friday night or sporting event in town.
I used to have the same basic commute, but a littler further on each end, so about 45 miles each way. By leaving at 6:00 AM, I could make it in 55 minutes on a perfect day. Always longer coming home (1:15 was a pretty good day). My record on a rainy Friday was about 2:45. Driving a stick, man my left leg was sore for a week after that trip.

Bradd, when I was 14 years old, we’d take the subway to Coney Island and stop at Nathan’s.  Hot dogs were 25 cents and a bag of their crinkly fries was 10 cents.  Cokes were 10 cents.  That was almost 60 years ago.  

I would never pay $5,00 for a hot dog - Nathan’s or not.  We were always good for a couple of hot dogs each, a bag of fries, a coke, and a hot ear of corn next door.  

We’d go on the Cyclone or the Tornado - old wooden roller-coasters.  Those were the days!

Our local favorite is Charlie's hot dogs for a buck (used to be 15 cents). The most fun you'll ever have giving yourself gastrointestinal distress.



In the old days you'd order a dozen and the cook would line them up his arm and slather on the condiments of your choice. Don't know if health codes allow that today.

Took a trip from Ft. Lauderdale to Punta Gorda yesterday to pick up minivans. A very nice ride and took us about 2 hours each way. Just took I-75, Alligator Alley, to and from and it was a breeze. Put the cruise on 73 and was a great drive as luckily there weren't too many cops around. The traffic kept passing me but 73 in a 70 zone felt very comfortable for me actually. The new minivan drove very nicely and luckily had SAT radio so I was a happy camper. Definitely miss the cross state driving days like I did a few years back. Going to Jacksonville one day and Key West the next was fun for me, the not knowing where we'd be headed day by day was fun actually. Enjoy the fact that I get paid to drive someone else's vehicle and they also pay the petrol and tolls is fine with me.
Was going to sign on with Enterprise like OF does a few months back but they stay within the county which kind of turned me off. Am already working about 30 hours/week at Hertz and they wanted me to do another 25/week for them. I felt the 55 hours/week was just a bit too much for me at my age and with my health issues was a bit too much.

Glad you're feeling better Sandy. I agree, those long trips are really enjoyable. Hertz keeps calling me but their work is mainly from the airport to the ""dirty line"" a mile away and having done that occasionally for Enterprise I think I'd go crazy.

We usually travel at 72 in a 65 up here as the troopers usually give you 10 over. One of our guys is an ex trooper and he says we're OK to 80 but none of us are daring enough to try that.

I also agree that getting paid to drive somebody else's cars (and sleep on the clock on the way back) is like a dream come true. Really gives you a perspective on the strengths and weaknesses of various cars. If I ever make it to Florida I'd want to do your job.

Maybe you can say hello to my in-laws when you move to central Florida. They just relocated to the St. Cloud area to be near grandkids too.

BTW one of the things we are going to do is some serious home shopping. our plan is to get a house lease it out until we retire, our current house should be paid off by then and we can just transfer ourselves into the Florida house. Hopefully the lease payments can pay down the house with minimal input from us.

Not sure where you live but I am in one of the largest metropolitan areas on the US. Here the only real variance occurs around holidays and there is a slightly noticeable difference between the summer months and the rest of the year. Other than that every road is going to have the same gridlock every rush hour.
Even when it's not ""rush hour,"" your metro area borders gridlock almost all the time! It is difficult to do, but I tend to reroute up to a couple hundred miles out of the way just avoid going through that mess.

DOT here is going to put in some fancy, obnoxious roundabout in an area where it is not needed because they claim this intersection is something like four times ""more dangerous"" than similar such locations in Alaska. The problem with that stat is that, over the last decade, there have been something like three (THREE) injury crashes, and no fatalities, at this location, with the rest of any collisions being minor at best. Compared to the flow of traffic through here, that stat basically says that you have ZERO chance of suffering an injury here unless you actually try to cause such a collision.

And, yet, this is enough for Federal funding, so why not make a fancy ""improvement"" that will inconvenience only those who have to use the location every day?

This is why people are so leery of government waste.... because it is justified! /sigh

4327,July 19,xwesx,"As far as the tariffs go, I find it a little amusing that we have knee-jerk articles like this that are intended to get people's alarm bells ringing. Yes, this type of thing is intended to raise consumer costs. Why? Because it influences consumer behavior and, therefore, tends to push manufacturers toward local production. Why don't people already get that?

So, if everyone is building stuff outside the US because it costs 20% less, then a tariff of 25% means they don't cost less anymore for consumers. No matter what, consumers lose on tariffs. However, the goal isn't to benefit consumers at all (and never was). The goal is to benefit national security because domestic manufacturing, regardless of what it is, means the nation can respond more quickly to any substantial threat should it arise. Case in point: WWII.

Very nice looking and it looks like you sprung for the better quality deck boards like I did which you won't find at the big boxes. I don't think I have a knot larger than a quarter and you have to look long and hard to find maybe the 20 that I do have. When I did mine I spent LOT of time making the deck look like a deck on a ship. Did tongue and groove on all the ends with a chamfer and since my deck is 40 feet long you can see why I said it took a LOT of time but in the end it was worth it. I am never in a hurry when I do something just like when working on my cars. I don't have to rush because I don't have another job that has to be done to pay the bills.

Yes, your deck will take some work but what you did looks better than plastic. Just be sure to stain it sooner than later. I do mine every other year and feel guilty when it slips to 3 years like it has a few times (my deck is about 18 years old).

Enjoy it, it looks very nice.

Please don’t - think like someone trying to justify aggressive driving!  One is enough on this forum.  When I think of aggressive driving, I think about the Indianapolis 500 or the Daytona 500.  I also think about drivers who cut in and out of lanes scaring the heck out of most drivers.  I also think about traffic violations and those who cause accidents but never get involved in accidents.  I think about speeders doing 20 mph over the limit.

However, there is the concept of defensive driving strategies - anticipating what other drivers might do or how best to avoid accidents.

Aggressive driving should be saved for the track or for use when an upcoming situation on the road demands it!

Yes, I run into this all the time. People call me up from say Ohio and ask if I can go look at a classic car they want to buy. My ads clearly say where I am and they seem to think I can drive to San Diego and back in a day.

I can't. I am often tempted to ask them if they realize that is the distance from Paris to Warsaw but of course I don't. I give them a California geography lesson. California is athletic. We're tall and lean.

SF has been totally messed up. Maybe if you're 21 and living with 5 room mates and partying all the time, it's a lot of fun, but for most people with real lives, it just gets harder and harder to live there. I was just down in China Basin area and they're building all these tall ""anthills"" for people to live in--just big metal boxes with outrageous rents and nary a tree or bench in sight. But you can buy an $8 piece of gourmet toast nearby. I'd shoot myself before I lived like that. I've found Manhattan much easier to deal with.

Last year around this time when I was looking at buying a CPO used car you might recall I quite liked the Fusion. What I discovered that most of the ones I found on lots were ex-fleet vehicles and were SE trim levels with option packages that added the 2.0 Ecoboost engine, 18"" alloys, leather seats, etc. There were a few Titanium trims available that had all that stuff as standard, along with a Sony-branded stereo and different/nicer leather seats, probably other things too. I think the Titaniums were all AWD too.
Enterprise has all three trim levels and I've delivered many a Fusion to dealers. Never noticed much difference in the Titanium trim except maybe better seats. Does the high trim come with NAV systems or other items that might jack up the used prices? I see AWD mentioned which I guess could add to the price.

100% Italian here, too. Like you, I make my own sauce, usually with “Farmer’s Market” plum tomatoes, fresh onions, good olive oil, etc. Make my own meatballs, too. Try to make my own pasta, too (have one of those fancy-shmantzy pasta attachments for the old Kitchenaid), if I have the time.

Even some of the “mom and pop” Italian restaurants around these parts aren’t all that good.

Funny story....5-6 years ago I was doing business with a large Brazilian Aerospace company named Embraer.

They would bring a gaggle of execs to meet at our Orlando office every quarter to discuss contracts, statements of work, and bid on some of their projects. They’d be here for a week, at least. Being the good host, I’d fly down to Orlando as I was the leader for these projects at the time. We’d have dinner every evening and given they’d been to our office many times, and knew the area, I’d let them choose where I would take them for dinner.

There’s no shortage of restaurants in Orlando, especially around International Drive, where they always stayed. Some of those restaurants were quite good. What did they choose? Olive Garden. They absolutely loved that place. Fine with me as it was easy on my expense account. But, of all the places I tried to take them, they loved OLIVE GARDEN. Far be it from me to explain to them that it wasn’t real Italian food.

SEAT HEATERS......I’ve set the temp on my TLX and it controls everything else, the cabin temp, whether to heat or cool the seats, which vents to utilize, etc to keep the temp in the cabin at my preset. It does a very good job of it, too.
The PROBLEM (ahem) is that Americans were exposed mostly to southern Italian cooking, which is heavy on sauces and very hearty, country-type food. There's a whole world of Italian cuisine that many Americans have never experienced, unless they live in large metro areas or go overseas. That type of cuisine uses a lot of fish and vegetable dishes, as well as pastas, beans and ""critters"" most of us have never even seen.

We told them about 4 that are really good; from a red checked tablecloth red sauce place to high end Northern Italian. When they were checking out, we asked them if they tried any of the restaurants, they said ""why didn't we tell them that there was an Olive Garden?"" BTW, it's 45 minutes away! They ate at an Olive Garden 5 times?!? What!

Well, technically it does not have a McD's, but there is one in South Burlington out by the interstate. Plus Burlington and environs has all of the usual suspects in the chain resto category including the dreaded Applebee's, Olive Garden, Longhorn, Chili's, Denny's, etc.

We used to visit Burlington almost annually on our summer vacations when I was a kid in the '70s.

There are some people that really like Olive Garden... to me it's the equivalvent of buying Prego and frozen meatballs. I'm Italian, make my own meatballs and gravy and other Italian dishes. It really drives me crazy when people think that is good ""Italian"" food

We are lucky in Jersey because along with Diners everywhere we also have fantastic local Italian restaurants. Many of them are BYOB and you can be out of there for $50 with tip and leave with leftovers.

The only chain Italian that is good is Maggiano's. All their food is cooked to order and has an actual chef.
100% Italian here, too. Like you, I make my own sauce, usually with “Farmer’s Market” plum tomatoes, fresh onions, good olive oil, etc. Make my own meatballs, too. Try to make my own pasta, too (have one of those fancy-shmantzy pasta attachments for the old Kitchenaid), if I have the time.

Even some of the “mom and pop” Italian restaurants around these parts aren’t all that good.

Funny story....5-6 years ago I was doing business with a large Brazilian Aerospace company named Embraer.

They would bring a gaggle of execs to meet at our Orlando office every quarter to discuss contracts, statements of work, and bid on some of their projects. They’d be here for a week, at least. Being the good host, I’d fly down to Orlando as I was the leader for these projects at the time. We’d have dinner every evening and given they’d been to our office many times, and knew the area, I’d let them choose where I would take them for dinner.

There’s no shortage of restaurants in Orlando, especially around International Drive, where they always stayed. Some of those restaurants were quite good. What did they choose? Olive Garden. They absolutely loved that place. Fine with me as it was easy on my expense account. But, of all the places I tried to take them, they loved OLIVE GARDEN. Far be it from me to explain to them that it wasn’t real Italian food.

However, in car listings I notice the Titanium trim is $3-5k more expensive than the others. Does this trim level have that much more equipment to justify the price difference or is it just that the upper trim level is more popular?

Speaking of restaurants I have a question for you far more worldly types than me.

For years I would see commercials for Applebee's on the US TV stations were receive here. Now, when I traveled into the USA over the years I tried most of the chains like TGI Fridays, Chili's, PF Chang's, Olive Garden, etc but somehow missed trying Applebee's. BTW I didn't mind Denny's when I visited there for breakfast.

About 10 years ago an Applebee's finally opened up here not far from where I worked. A few of us tried it at lunch shortly after it opened and it was... terrible. Reminded me of airline food with lots of salt and cheese added. Figured maybe they were still new so I stayed away for a few months before going back. It was the same if not worse. Got the impression everything was frozen, then microwaved and finished under a broiler or whatever. I knew it wasn't just me because after that everyone I asked who had been there said much the same thing. Sure enough it closed after a couple more years.

Did we just get a bad one or are they all like that?

Perhaps they're all like that. The one time I ate at a local one I was disappointed. Used to like TGIF but had a few bad experiences there too.

High humidity? Arizona? WTH?


In the summer, Arizona is affected by a south to southwesterly monsoonal flow of moist air from the Gulf of California which causes high humidity and heavy rains as far west as the State Border with CA (Blythe area) and covers a large section of the State.  

When I lived in Palm Desert, CA, I could often see lightening from thunderstorm to the east of us near the Blythe area.  We were not affected in the Coachella Valley because we are surrounded to the west, south and north by 8000-10,000 ft. mountains which interfere with the formation of thunderstorms by cutting of the moisture flow.  We were also further west and not affected by the monsoonal flow.

When I lived in Phoenix in the mid 1980's, the population of the greater metro area was, I think, 1.5 million. Now, it's over 4.5 million, and all those extra people, and the plants, grasses and trees that come with the development, have affected the climate.

In addition to the monsoon stuff that @abacomike talked about, which were pretty impressive. Anyone know what a ""haboob"" is?

Unfortunately a highway can only accommodate a finite number of cars and still maintain a smooth flow of traffic. During rush hour far more cars attempt to use highways than they can accommodate at a normal flow. This slows down traffic sometimes to a crawl with all lanes filled doing very close to the same speed. In this situation would you ticket all the thousands of cars? To do so would make the situation worse.

I'd use the reasonable and prudent law enforcement standard, and in many cases, it isn't reasonable or prudent for cars to impede traffic at the same exact speed across all lanes; even if it is a dozen simultaneous violators.

A couple went to the hospital to have their baby delivered. Upon their arrival the doctor said that the hospital was testing an amazing new high-tech machine that would transfer a portion of the mother's labor pain to the baby's father He asked if they were interested. Both said they were very much in favor of it
The doctor set the pain transfer to 10% for starters, explaining that even 10% was probably more pain than the father had ever experienced before But as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and kick it up a notch. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20% pain transfer The husband was still feeling fine. The doctor then checked the husband's blood pressure and was amazed at how well he was doing.
At this point they decided to try for 50%. The husband continued to feel quite well. Since the pain transfer was obviously helping the wife considerably the husband encouraged the doctor to transfer ALL the pain to him.
The wife subsequently delivered a healthy baby with virtually no pain and the husband continued to experience no pain. She and her husband were ecstatic.

It's all relative (intended), but in July through September or so there's a significant shot of moisture that comes up from the south and is therefore called a monsoon. What it means is that the humidity goes from 5 - 15% to 40% plus, sometimes 70%. The key is dew point, and it goes up to 55 - 65 degrees during the monsoon, and often above 70. That means that it doesn't become much less hot overnight, such that the lowest temperature is 93 degrees at 6:30 am, after which it goes up again. Today it was 109. Often it's 104 at 11 pm.

While you can't always control the speed due to obstructions in front of you, you can avoid entering the passing lanes without an ability to pass. If you find yourself unable or unwilling to pass, you should again move right except to pass. As I said, bumper to bumper stop and go traffic is an exception as everything has broken down at that point.

I often see the right lane become the defacto passing lane due to impeders in the passing lane.

Vermont is a very ""foody"" place. I think that the term ""farm to table"" was first used here and there are a lot of great local restaruants. We have very few chain restaurants, and Burlington doesn't even have a McD's. (For trivia buffs, Montpelier is the only State capital without a McD's.)

Son had a terrible time delay getting from DAY to Reagan International on Sunday evening: a couple hours weather delay.
Coming back last night again a little weather and his 7:20 flight became a 9:20 flight out. But we assumed he was on that flight, because he didn't want to change flight to an earlier flight out. Instead, this morning we learned that he had switched to a later flight because there was a problem with the 9:20 delay flight. But the 10:30 flight did an emergency landing. He said there was an ABS problem--was it made by Takata? LOL

That's all we know. I checked plane's track for last night on flightaware and it did a circle around our airport here after flying over the control tower at low altitude and low speed for almost 15 minutes. Then landed on the longer runway of the 3.

The last flight is a larger plane than the 50-seat earlier planes. OR due to delayed flights into Reagan they needed seats on the plane that left at 9:20 for connecting folks who missed earlier flights and they offered him a voucher for switching to the later flight?
It is a litle humorous to me that this scenario really is typical of a modern day ""terrible time delay"" on airlines. Oh, how good we have it now! In the 90's, not once did I make it across the lower 48 without the trip taking upwards of 24 hours (scheduled time was typically about eight hours). I imagine most, if not all of us, have a few ""horror stories"" we could share!

Just last night as we were going out to dinner, I pull up behind a new or newer Legacy with a red pearl paint job. It really looked good compared to the blah 2012 Silver Legacy that Mrs. j has. I purposely didn't say anything because it was our anniversary and didn't want to get into it with her about cars and that hers should be replaced. I'm a dope but not that big of one, at least not on that day. It's a long light and finally Mrs. j says, ""that's a nice color on that Legacy. I guess that is the color you'd want me to get if I got a new one, huh""? Whoever said there aren't car gods is wrong because there was one in the car with us last night. Then she goes on to say, ""yeah, that's a nice color but you'd want one with two pipes under the bumper not one like that one has, right""? I still think there are car gods because she used to call them ""round things"".

Because of last night I now think I have a chance of her changing her mind about getting a new car. Yep, yesterday was a good day all around.

2 things you can put in the script which I think is kind of funny;

1) They use the car his father provides as a company car as their personal car (cheat and lie), then B&E our house, then steal our car, then lie about a lost wallet....and they don't want to talk to me about it because I said I didn't believe his wallet story and all the other stories and excuses I have had over the years....and they don't want to talk to me because I was rude.

2) My plan was to tell him not to talk to me at family events...he could say hi and goodbye. Their plan, which reached me via my wife, is they barred me from any of their things. So, if a grandchild gets married, my wife will have to go alone. That may be hard to explain to his parents and family members...but, he will make up some story. But, my way, there would still be a bit of a cover up and things would continue. Their way, I am going to be noticeably absent and my poor lovely wife will have to go on her own.

I am hoping they notice this and ask me to change it to what I was going to propose. Then I can say, that was my original plan, but, I like your plan better.

I never understood that law, and I'd be curious to see when it is enforced. NJ has both no pass on right AND keep right except to pass laws. So, theoretically, a left lane camper can completely impede an entire highway if everyone were to follow the no pass on right law. And what happens when someone does pass? Which offense takes priority? The camper or the passer? These are the things I ponder while traveling our roadways.

Well... my take is that the idiotic law enforcement officer does idiotic things, like ticket speeders and passers on the right, or some other hogwash.

In the summer, Arizona is affected by a south to southwesterly monsoonal flow of moist air from the Gulf of California which causes high humidity and heavy rains as far west as the State Border with CA (Blythe area) and covers a large section of the State.  

When I lived in Palm Desert, CA, I could often see lightening from thunderstorm to the east of us near the Blythe area.  We were not affected in the Coachella Valley because we are surrounded to the west, south and north by 8000-10,000 ft. mountains which interfere with the formation of thunderstorms by cutting of the moisture flow.

4501,July 17,dino001,"So I just came back from vacation in Scotland previous Sunday. A bit more than two weeks, first one I enjoyed the cities (Edinburgh, Glasgow and vicinity) then I rented a car and drove to the countryside to see their legendary landscapes. The landscapes did not disappoint, the only regret was I should have shortened my city stay and lengthen the countryside. Anyway, I drove a manual transmission Passat with the steering wheel on the right hand side, gear shifter on the left and of course I had to stay on the proper side of the roads and intersections. Here come the impressions:

First three days can be described as horror. The left side of the road and intersections were actually the least terrifying aspects, except perhaps multilane roundabouts, where I may sometimes have not been a model driver. I was honked only three times over that period, which I consider a personal triumph. HOWEVER, the vehicle width and depth perceptions was all messed up. Right is left, left is right, everything had to be relearned. And Passat is a pretty large vehicle (should have gotten a Golf or Focus). Within 30 MINUTES I hit a trash can, dislodged the passenger (right) mirror and scratched the front quarter panel. I made a mistake of picking the car in the dusk, which meant I drove it on narrow streets of Edinburgh (to get to my hotel) after dark. It was a miracle I did not hit more. So I drove my car with passenger mirror out of alignment, but fortunately I was not using multilane roads, so it didn't matter. Other things did.
Day one - terrified of every vehicle coming from the opposite lane, including Smart
Day two - terrified of trucks and buses coming
Day three - still uncomfortable with buses.

BTW, the roads there are narrow, commonly with 10 ft or so lanes and no shoulder. On those days I ended up kissing the curb many times (as you'll naturally drift away from oncoming traffic, especially if you don't have a good feel for the width of the vehicle), but fortunately the curbs were low and the tires were high enough, so it was only an uncomfortable ""kick"", rather than all out grinding of the rims.

By day four I generally got decent handle of it, enough not to be scared all the time. I still had sometimes uncomfortable moments, when my weak left hand couldn't feel the shifter too well on gear reductions, making me slow down too much and delay taking off on some roundabouts, but it wasn't too bad, just not too smooth. Anyway, I would still avoid driving on the left side of the road in cities and after dark, but country was alright. Overall it was exhausting, though.

On other subject - the Passat (it was a diesel, rather base version, but still some decent equipment) was OK, but its entertainment and media center was completely baffling. I could not figure out a consistent way to make it play navigation directions from my phone: one time it would do nothing, another it would silence the podcast feed, but still not say anything, another time it would actually play the directions through the speakers. For the life of me, I didn't know how to make it do it every time. It was something about streaming through the USB vs. Bluetooth, but only God and Hans knew what the exact settings were.

I haven't spent any seat time in a JL, but from what I've read it has much more civilized on-road behavior while retaining the off-road capability that Wranglers are known for. As to amenities, the new JL can be equipped with a full set of Helen Keller ""driver's aids"" as well as LED lighting, heated seats, navigation, and a decent ""premium"" audio system.

Unfortunately, the situation did not end well. I wrote an email to my daughter saying there was no excuse for taking someone's car etc, and I did say the S-I-L would find his wallet, because he didn't really lose it. My wife went there today to visit, they were both there, they told her my email was rude and they don't want to talk to me any more.

I know the SIL has control over her and has told her all kinds of lies about how I cheated him, and he shut any discussion down before I could have a say. I am glad to get rid of him, I can now sleep at night, she wants to believe in him, and that is her life. She is living a lie with a big phony, but, if that is what she wants to do, that is OK with me.

Back in 2009 when I was thinking of getting an '09 Genny, I was in Son #1's family room discussing the car since it was just introduced and it had gotten some kind of an award. I think it was North American Car of the Year Award. Anyway after talking about it for about 15 minutes, Mrs. j jumps up and says something like, ""I don't want to hear anymore about getting a new car we don't need a car"" and she leaves the room putting her hands over her ears. After about and hour of talking about the cars specs from a brochure I picked up at a dealer and him looking at info online, I've pretty much convinced myself that I'm going to get one in Cabernet Read Pearl with a V8. Just have to see who has it at the right price. Like I said we discussed this car for about an hour and I remember my Son saying, ""that seems like a nice car and even though the V8 cost more, there is no sense in going half way by getting the V6"". Then he says, ""do you really think you should be spending your grandkids inheritance like that""? Too late, I had already made up my mind. I know my Son and I know he was kidding but it was humorous to me and Mrs. j when she heard about it.

Being the grandparents of 5 (4 boys and a girl), we try to have a good time with them, which of course means spending money sometimes. We don't think we over do it but we immensely enjoy watching them have a good time with what we give them. We'd rather see them enjoy it while we can still see it because we know nothing down the road is guaranteed. For us this is the way to do it but everyone has to do it their own way and I'm sure you will have some left over for your grandchildren too.

I do the same thing, JM.  When my son comes to see me, whether it’s with his SO or with one of his sons each August, I always pay for their airline tickets and I take them shopping one full day for clothes, shoes, and goodies.  It’s my way of sharing what I have with them.  We go out for dinner every night and brunch every day.  We go to the movies or do something they want to do.

I give my son $100 each month to help him with his health insurance premiums and just before he leaves to go home to Palm Desert, I give him a check for a few thousand dollars because I know he needs it.  He works 12+ hours every day and part of every Saturday.  Why not see him and my grandchildren enjoy what I provide them rather than have him spend his inheritance when I am gone.  If my surviving daughter had any kind of normal relationship with me, I would do the same for her.  I have offered to pay her way down here but she refuses.  Her loss, my son’ and grandsons”s gain!

Most importantly, it gives me pleasure!   

I wonder how he’ll (my son) react to my 2018 S450?  He will probably say, “.. enjoy the new car Dad...”!

@jmonroe - Mazel-Tov on your anniversary!  A few years ago at a family wedding, they had a dance for “all the married couples.”  After a few minutes, the band asked all the couples who had been married 1 year or less to get off the dance floor, then 5, 10, 20...  My parents were the last couple dancing together having been married over 40 years.  It is something to be very proud of.

We’ve got to talk about 7,500 miles in your ownership period of your “new Genny.”  I think it is th color.  Trade that sucker in for a new Cabarnet Red V8 powered G90 and you’ll put more miles on it.  Either that or convince MRS J that she needs to ditch her Legacy for a Genny of her own.


I don't need two Genny's in the garage due to jealousy reasons but this post is VERY much on time:

Just last night as we were going out to dinner, I pull up behind a new or newer Legacy with a red pearl paint job. It really looked good compared to the blah 2012 Silver Legacy that Mrs. j has. I purposely didn't say anything because it was our anniversary and didn't want to get into it with her about cars and that hers should be replaced. I'm a dope but not that big of one, at least not on that day. It's a long light and finally Mrs. j says, ""that's a nice color on that Legacy. I guess that is the color you'd want me to get if I got a new one, huh""? Whoever said there aren't car gods is wrong because there was one in the car with us last night. Then she goes on to say, ""yeah, that's a nice color but you'd want one with two pipes under the bumper not one like that one has, right""? I still think there are car gods because she used to call them ""round things"".

Because of last night I now think I have a chance of her changing her mind about getting a new car. Yep, yesterday was a good day all around.

Coming back last night again a little weather and his 7:20 flight became a 9:20 flight out. But we assumed he was on that flight, because he didn't want to change flight to an earlier flight out. Instead, this morning we learned that he had switched to a later flight because there was a problem with the 9:20 delay flight. But the 10:30 flight did an emergency landing. He said there was an ABS problem--was it made by Takata? LOL

That's all we know. I checked plane's track for last night on flightaware and it did a circle around our airport here after flying over the control tower at low altitude and low speed for almost 15 minutes. Then landed on the longer runway of the 3.

The last flight is a larger plane than the 50-seat earlier planes. OR due to delayed flights into Reagan they needed seats on the plane that left at 9:20 for connecting folks who missed earlier flights and they offered him a voucher for switching to the later flight?

Speaking of restaurants I have a question for you far more worldly types than me.

For years I would see commercials for Applebee's on the US TV stations were receive here. Now, when I traveled into the USA over the years I tried most of the chains like TGI Fridays, Chili's, PF Chang's, Olive Garden, etc but somehow missed trying Applebee's. BTW I didn't mind Denny's when I visited there for breakfast.

About 10 years ago an Applebee's finally opened up here not far from where I worked. A few of us tried it at lunch shortly after it opened and it was... terrible. Reminded me of airline food with lots of salt and cheese added. Figured maybe they were still new so I stayed away for a few months before going back. It was the same if not worse. Got the impression everything was frozen, then microwaved and finished under a broiler or whatever. I knew it wasn't just me because after that everyone I asked who had been there said much the same thing. Sure enough it closed after a couple more years.

Be careful how you approach this with your daughter as she sees him through her eyes and experiences not yours. Many people see criticism of their spouse as criticism of themselves, sort of suggesting that they make poor choices or are to sense to know things.

Also consider that there is their side of the story and that either there is a rational explanation of why they did that or that she has rationalized his actions. so that any criticism will be met with ""you just don't understand"".

Finally people do know the faults of their spouses and still love them despite those faults and any complaint about them isn't going to do any good. You also have to understand that with many people they will stand by their spouse and will take the stance that if their spouse isn't welcomed then they aren't either.

I would talk with both and let them know that I was not happy with their actions and would prefer that things like that would not happen again. Doing it in a non accusatory way, then take steps to make sure it doesn't like change codes and hide keys while away. But that's just me.

In conclusion tread carefully if you want to maintain good relations with the daughter.

A few years ago at a family wedding, they had a dance for “all the married couples.”  After a few minutes, the band asked all the couples who had been married 1 year or less to get off the dance floor, then 5, 10, 20...  My parents were the last couple dancing together having been married over 40 years.  It is something to be very proud of.

We’ve got to talk about 7,500 miles in your ownership period of your “new Genny.”  I think it is th color.  Trade that sucker in for a new Cabarnet Red V8 powered G90 and you’ll put more miles on it.  Either that or convince MRS J that she needs to ditch her Legacy for a Genny of her own.

@driver100 - Steve, I can’t believe how low your piece of trash son in law stooped.  I don’t envy your position at all.  Unfortunately I’ve learned in my short 42 years on this earth that the right thing and the easy thing are almost never the same.  You’ve put up with his crap for long enough.

@abacomike - enjoy your time with your grandson.  One thing I’ve always been thankful for is the fact that I had 2 parents and 4 grandparents growing up.  My kids too.  There really is nothing like having a relationship with your grandparent or grandchild.

@xwex - it’s difficult enough raising kids these days in any capacity!  You and your wife are doing an exemplary job.  Just the fact that you both care so much in your own way speaks volumes.

4546,July 17,graphicguy,"Regarding TV habits, I really don’t watch TV unless it’s to watch someone throwing a ball, hitting a ball, catching a ball, kicking a ball or throwing a ball.

I don’t watch TV news except for CBS This Morning on Sunday mornings and 60 Minutes. I don’t need the rest to tell me what to think or what their opinion is. I’m capable of that on my own.

I do read a lot of newspapers and publications....(Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Chicago Tribune). Hell, I don’t even read my local paper anymore. It’s a shell of what it used to be and the only thing I need from it are sports scores, which I can find on my phone. I read a lot of business and tech pubs (Forbes, Wired, etc).

The last series I think I watched was while I was still married, 3-4 years ago. She liked to watch “Shameless” with William H Macy (who was outstanding). It’s a pretty brutally, over the top show about the foibles of an Irish family living in the south side of Chicago living most of their lives screwing up. Pretty graphic in all aspects, though. Actually, it’s a show some would find distasteful. I rather liked it, but the she loved it. Of course, she also loved the Bachelor and Bachlorette. I would watch that with her and I could feel my IQ drop every moment I watched it.

Home Run Derby was fun last night. I do like the Planet Earth Series (especially in 4K).

I am watching more and more movies in 4K in my home theater. Pretty spectacular what they’re doing with surround sound (Atmos) and picture quality these days.

Mr Snake....you are a wise man. What you have said is very true. My wife was a family councilor and we had this discussion this morning. I wanted to tell our daughter what he is all about, I felt it was necessary to warn her. My beautiful and wise wife said....she is living in a fantasy world, she has her 3 children, she has a wonderful career....she loves her husband and he won't leave her because he has the life he wants. She won't believe me, and my wife doesn't want us to be responsible for ruining her fairy tale world. If it were me, I would want to know what I was married to, but, then again....the partner in the marriage doesn't want to know about those faults.

All I can do is politely say I don't want anything more to do with him. I will be civilized in public or family functions, but, other than that I want nothing to do with him.

We're still reeling from the loss of a family member - our Pomeranian Cotey. The house is much quieter now - especially at feeding times.

We have our son from Tucson for several more days - we enjoy his visits and we've enjoyed showing him some of southern New Mexico's outdoor delights - we're blessed to have the Sacramento Mountains just to our east to go explore and capture some of the Pacific Northwest back again. It's amazing - from the desert of Alamogordo and White Sands National Monument to Alamo and then 16 miles east up the mountain and we've got elk, deer, bobcat, cougar, bear and coyote, trees and streams and hiking trails to view them from.

You always amaze me stick with your common sense. That is an excellent plan and that will be plan B for sure.
The last time daughter emailed her mother she said we will sit down when you get back..........if that gets arranged might as well do it, if not, I would go with your plan.....which technically is better, but, there is a reason I think it is better if she initiates it.

The reason being....I said something very powerful in my email to her....I said he will mysteriously find his licence very shortly because I know him, and he won't want to apply for his license, health card, credit cards again (since he doesn't do much work anyway). Within a few days he will find his wallet. I said I have heard his stories and excuses over the years, so I know how it works. He did find it the next day. That is the first shred of evidence she actually knows about now.....so, I want to see what happens.

4561,July 16,driver100,"xwesx, Great post for a few reasons.
First though, yes, he could have rented a car but the thing about the S-I-L is, he is incompetent. Our daughter leaves early in the morning and travels about 30 miles out of town for work. Maybe she was going to take the Lexus that day so he could pick up his mother in the Mercedes, that is what they usually do....though if we were here my good hearted wife usually takes his mother for the once a month eye appointment. He probably had an appointment for 11 with his 2008 Lexus, and thought they could fix it right away, but, when they told him it would take a day he only had a bit of time to find a white Mercedes GLK.

He wouldn't rent a car or take a taxi....won't spend money on things like that. Will spend $500 to go to a hockey game though.

It was a great post because you said the best approach is to let bygones be bygones. That is what I have done for about 5 years now even though he scammed us and others through our business. But, this was the final straw.....it is impossible to let bygones be bygones when someone like this who has no conscience basically steals your car. Once you let it go he will do something again....it means nothing to him, the end justifies the means as far as he is concerned.

If there is a small misunderstanding, I would agree, try to let it go, it isn't worth the aggravation, and sometimes a small thing gets blown out of proportion.

I would definitely try that first, but, I tried it for 5 years and then he pulls this whopper and thinks nothing of it.

What if I woke up with a tooth ache and my car wouldn't start? Would I go to his house and take his car? Geez, I can't imagine someone even thinking of doing it. Rent a car, take a cab, call a friend......if he could get to his mothers in a taxi he could have used her car.

I agree; with that much history, he has pretty much said loud and clear that he has no respect for you as people; you're only another means for him. This is definitely that strong sense of entitlement I noted. It is like customers throwing an all-out tantrum with a customer service rep in a store, or a dog chasing cars. As long as you let them get away with it, they're just encouraged to keep doing it.

Case in point: I used to get into arguments with my wife because she didn't (perhaps still doesn't) like my driving policy of not stopping/swerving for dogs that run out into the road to chase cars. I'll slow for them, but I won't stop, and I won't swerve. We had lots of ""near misses"" over the years with the dogs gaining just enough sense to avert collision at the last moment. Then, a new neighbor moved in a few houses up from me with a dog that was unbelievably belligerent about car chasing, to the point that one morning one of my other neighbors almost swerved into me as I left the area for work because that dog leapt out at them and they tried to avoid it.

A few days later, we're driving home and the dog jumps out at us. I was going about fifteen. I hit it, dog bounces off the bumper, screams bloody murder, and runs away. My wife was infuriated with me at first. Later, I checked with the owners to inform them of the strike for awareness, but the dog was fine.

Never again did it chase a car. I was happy, wife was happy, and dog was happy (and alive).

Sounds like it's time to break your SIL of his sense of entitlement, and I think you might need to work with HIS parents so you all come out ahead. Tricky situation, though, so proceed slowly and, whatever you do, don't swerve.

I hope that for you as well! Such relationships are so valuable. And, I wouldn't say that I am ""extremely adept."" I tend to be fairly analytical, so I just try to be practical about acting on my observations and conclusions. ASD is such a tricky ""disorder"" because that spectrum can manifest itself in so many ways; each child is different in how the condition affects them and what approaches get through. He visited several professionals when he was very young, and they all had their opinions about how best to parent them, but honestly I just felt like they were trying to make us into their personal marionettes. I appreciated the information as I gained more respect for the depth of the challenges I had to deal with day to day (which often times were just annoying/frustrating to me in the context of a ""normal child""), so it wasn't all a loss there. My son is very strong on verbal communication - he was speaking full sentences at fifteen months - but he also doesn't know when to zip it. I think he's starting to learn that now, slowly, but it puts up a major barrier to communicating with others (perhaps ironically?) because they don't want to listen to him blather on about every detail of some topic of interest to him without ever being able to get a word in edgewise! It is a particular barrier with his age group, and it doesn't help that he's typically smarter than five of them together, so his interests don't align either. It's tricky for him....
I am quite familiar with the repetitive and unending dissertation that my grandson utilizes in his communications with me on the phone - similar but not exactly perseveration.  Last year, I called him for his birthday, as I always do.  He thanked me and almost instantaneously went into quite a precise dissertation on the possibility of life on other planets or in our galaxy.  He described, in detail, what his spaceship would look like and the supplies it would have to have on board in order to prove his “hypothesis” (his word, not mine) that life exists out there in the far reaches of space (his words, not mine).

After about 25 minutes of this on the phone, I had to stop him and asked to speak with his mother.  Whew!!!

My son does not have the patience needed to work with my grandson as you do.  He concentrates more on the 17 year old boy who is on his way to college on several scholarships.  His mother is even worse, which was the major cause of his divorce.  They have shared custody, but that environment is not a healthy one for the boy.  Whatever time my son has after his 12 hour work days shortchanged his youngest son because he devotes so much time and energy for the older son.  

That’s why I am so keen on spending three straight days with my youngest grandson.

I noticed on the itinerary from American Airlines that the two of them were not seated together on the first leg of their flight home.  So I called my son to inform him that I would pay for the preferred seating on that flight so they could sit together.  Having Aspergers, I thought that sitting next to two strangers in his row of seating might be too stressful for him.  So they are now seated together on that flight.

Family sh.. - most every honest person will tell you they have experienced some. Basically though, you may just have to roll with some of it if you want to keep good relations with your daughter. Generally, I think you will be glad you didn't sever them when on your deathbed unless she has become truly awful to you, your wife and the rest of your family. That's my two cents (US currency please ) and it may not be worth that!
Just to be clear....I wouldn't do the severing. I did have to use tough love on youngest daughter though. She was angry about something for a long time and we had a big difference of opinion about lifestyle and values etc., I think the key in her case was saying we could have different values, opinions etc., but, still love each other. We avoid those topics and it has worked well, and she has changed to become more mainstream - and I think enjoying life more with a good paying interesting job.

But, there comes a point to where kids will take advantage. They will act out so you will give in or give them something...usually money. Sometimes, you do have to draw the line and realize that they may just be using you. Hopefully it will never get to that point.

Thanks for sharing! Sounds like an interesting one. I probably will not end up seeing it due to it being held captive behind the Netflix paywall, but good to know it is out there!

We watched a movie many years back called Temple Grandin, starring Claire Danes. Also a good one, and she did a fantastic job with the role.

My son has Aspberger's, and taking things literally was one thing that he did quite well. I am often being facetious, sarcastic, or just generally figurative in my speech, so I made a point of doing this around him frequently. After directing him toward my literal meaning for a few years, and always being sure to use non-verbal queues that made it more than obvious (to normal people) that I am not saying precisely what I mean, he began to pause after such statements and say, ""You aren't being serious, are you....""

Now, at fourteen, he picks up on that stuff fairly well (even if not as easily as others who do not have this ASD trait) and with anyone.
That is a brilliant tactic xwesx. Well done.

Our daughter will be called A here, my wife is B and you know who gets a big X!

This happened while we were in London;

We are in London. X (son in law) has a 2008 L.e.x.u.s. on its last legs. His father's company leased him a 2015 Mercedes that his wife drives, because she is the bread winner and has to go 30 miles to work. His father thinks he is using the Mercedes that looks just like my wife's car. and it happens to be a white GLK just like my wifes car.

On Thursday just before Hamilton starts A emails that X has to take his mother to the eye doctor, his car is getting repaired, can he use my wifes car, which looks the same as A's car. Remember, his mother and father don't know my daughter is using the company car, and he is using his old Lexus every day.

We ignore her email thinking they would find another option, like renting a car.

We get another email, that X had to take his car to Lexus for a repair, they won't give him a loaner because he lost his wallet and license the day before. They decided that he would just take my wife's car. They have a key to the house for emergencies, they know the security code, and he took the car.

That to me is theft. Also, what happens if he is stopped and is driving without a licence?
If he is an accident it would go on our insurance.....except I would report the car stolen, and it would be on his insurance.

We are both really upset....they do this behind our backs while we are in England. I wrote A that they have intruded on my vacation, that I want the car returned first thing in the morning, and they have a lot of nerve taking someone's car without getting permission. I told them that car isn't just my wife's car....it is our car, and they need permission from both of us to take it, and I didn't give permission and I wouldn't give permission, and incidentally she would never give him permission.....we would probably give our daughter permission for a real situation.

Btw....I don't believe he lost his wallet. I think he wanted my wife's car because it looks like their car and if he used it his mother would think it was his car. I wrote to our daughter and said he hasn't lost his wallet, I know him too well, he is too lazy to fill out all the forms....he will have found his wallet by early in the week....I thought about Monday. I wrote that early Saturday morning.....by Saturday evening he was on Messenger....someone had returned his wallet. How did I know he would have his wallet back.....I have seen him in action for a few years.

The lock on the house will be changed and the security code has been changed. That reminds me....are those front door locks with the codes any good? We will make arrangements to see them soon....and he will be told in no uncertain terms if he comes to our house when we aren't there, or takes a car he will be charged. I am sure they will apologize profusely, probably bring flowers or a gift certificate for a restaurant and I will say I don't want it and I don't want a meaningless apology. You apologize when you spill a drink on someone.....this is in your character, that never changes, and since I don't want to deal with it any more....say hello at a family function, and move on.

Mr Driver has serious jet lag this morning. Got up at 6 a.m. London time yesterday, got to the airport at 10 a.m. for a 12:30 flight home. They had to replace the windshield in the plane (Speedy auto glass?), decided the windshield had to dry, so they switched planes. Got off the ground at 5 p.m., with 5 hours difference got to our house at 9 p.m. Unpacked, caught up on essentials until 11 p.m. Had been up for 22 hours. Left for tennis at 7:30 this morning.
Now I am home....but, going for groceries soon.
I second the other comment about why go to play tennis on such little rest.

Our son had to fly to Reagan National at 5 last evening. I won't mention the airline because I think it's the DC airport's fault, but this time the plane didn't leave the runway here at Dayton International until 8:44 pm. Normally it's 20-40 minutes late. He's had to fly for his business on this non-stop a few times before.

There was a miscommunication between the pilot and the gate attendant at about 7:30 and the passengers were all deplaned. Then they were reloaded apparently.

I think the airline owes them all a free ride in compensation. I'll suggest that to my son. He didn't get to bed until 12 and had to be up at 3 am to get ready and get to wherever this appointment was.

He flies home on the same airline this evening. This flight also has trouble leaving on time especially if there's any weather occurring in that area.

Driver, what you really need is a ""DIVORCE""! Not from your wife - from your son-in-law. Lawyers are forever advertising on TV that they handle speeding tickets, bad knee replacements, that long word that means asbestos caused lung disease (mesothelioma), car accidents, slip and falls, to name just a small percentage of the kinds of lawyers and the cases they like to handle. So there has to be a legal firm out there that handles ""son-in-law divorces""! Have your son-in-law ""served"" with divorce papers as soon as is feasible - let him know the reason for the divorce - irreconcilable differences! Get this divorce consummated as soon as you can - living with this idiot is not good for your health, your wife's health, and certainly OUR health since we have to read your son-in-law posts at least once a week.

I hope that for you as well! Such relationships are so valuable.

And, I wouldn't say that I am ""extremely adept."" I tend to be fairly analytical, so I just try to be practical about acting on my observations and conclusions. ASD is such a tricky ""disorder"" because that spectrum can manifest itself in so many ways; each child is different in how the condition affects them and what approaches get through. He visited several professionals when he was very young, and they all had their opinions about how best to parent them, but honestly I just felt like they were trying to make us into their personal marionettes. I appreciated the information as I gained more respect for the depth of the challenges I had to deal with day to day (which often times were just annoying/frustrating to me in the context of a ""normal child""), so it wasn't all a loss there.

My son is very strong on verbal communication - he was speaking full sentences at fifteen months - but he also doesn't know when to zip it. I think he's starting to learn that now, slowly, but it puts up a major barrier to communicating with others (perhaps ironically?) because they don't want to listen to him blather on about every detail of some topic of interest to him without ever being able to get a word in edgewise! It is a particular barrier with his age group, and it doesn't help that he's typically smarter than five of them together, so his interests don't align either. It's tricky for him....

4614,July 16,xwesx,"@driver100 Head scratcher. I honestly cannot follow any reasonable logic that would lead them to think that taking your car was the best course of action. I mean, if having a white MB was the most prudent step for them to take to meet that need, WHY could they not have simply used your daughter's car?! As you noted, a rental is always an option for situations like that. It baffles me that somehow them playing musical cars (between themselves) was not a viable plan, but that going through the trouble to literally take your car was such a clear and obvious choice. Wow....

It seems like your actions so far are the most reasonable approach: You made it quite clear that they leaped over a line there, and they are not welcome to do so again. In fact, you set the line a lot closer to their side of the court just to drive home that point. I'm not sure how or if you can break through that strong sense of entitlement in one-or-both of them, but my approach would be to let bygones be bygones at this point and keep an open mind for what comes next.

I have had nearly all of my siblings and siblings-in-law do something of a similar scale as this. They know what they did, and they have to live with it. I don't bring it up and don't let it play into our future interactions, but they also darn sure know that they'll never do it again or ask me for another favor unless they figure out a way to make amends now (in some cases this means a decade or two down the road from when it occurred....).

I'd suggest a Ford discount might be more likely. I was amazed when we'd visit friends living in the Canton/Plymouth upscale area and there were so many Lincolns on the road and in the driveways. I'm sure there are lots of GM associated plans for discounts there, too, so your point is well taken.

It's just that here in flyover country Lincolns were not as common then as I saw in SE Michigan.

I enjoy some action and violence, but more like “Reds” and “Reds 2” as well as the “Mission Impossible” flicks with Tom Cruise where they mix in some humor along with the suspense.  Like the James Bond movies also because there is a mix of suspense, humor, drama and violence.

In general I don't pay much attention to what @driver100 says but he seems to be jealous that a few people including a woman liked the 2015 black Altima that I had as a rental when Mrs. j's Subie was in the body shop getting a right front fender replaced in 2016. This jealousy probably stems from when his old Benz was rear ended and totaled and no one commented on the rentals he had.

As you all know, I have a keen interest in children with Autism - especially Asperger's Syndrome. One of my friends asked me if I subscribed to Netflix - and my response was that I do. He suggested I go on to Netflix and search for one of their short series entitled, ""ATYPICAL"". It is a 6 part series about a high school teenager who suffers from autism - probably with Asperger's Syndrome. It is a comedy drama series about the frustrations the boy experiences - like taking verbal comments made to him ""literally"" rather than figuratively. It includes his interactions with other 17 and 18 year olds, his mother and father, his sister and the family as a whole and how they deal with life.

I found it one of the very best series I have ever viewed. I laughed at the various situations he gets himself in and out of. My eyes teared at his frustrations and insecurities. I empathized with the parents as well as sister.

It is unbelievably well acted by all characters. It's a must see if you want some good laughs and some serious knowledge about these neurological disorders from the perspective of the boy, the parents, the sister and all tose he comes into contact with.

In the last episode, it seems as if there will be another 7-8 episodes based upon the way it ended.

Remember, ""ATYPICAL"" on Netflix.
Thanks for sharing! Sounds like an interesting one. I probably will not end up seeing it due to it being held captive behind the Netflix paywall, but good to know it is out there!

We watched a movie many years back called Temple Grandin, starring Claire Danes. Also a good one, and she did a fantastic job with the role.

My son has Aspberger's, and taking things literally was one thing that he did quite well. I am often being facetious, sarcastic, or just generally figurative in my speech, so I made a point of doing this around him frequently. After directing him toward my literal meaning for a few years, and always being sure to use non-verbal queues that made it more than obvious (to normal people) that I am not saying precisely what I mean, he began to pause after such statements and say, ""You aren't being serious, are you....""

Now, at fourteen, he picks up on that stuff fairly well (even if not as easily as others who do not have this ASD trait) and with anyone.

out of curiosity I ran an amortization schedule on my Elantra. If I target the 3 year point to pay off the balance that should be easy to do. I normally never want a loan longer than that anyway. Plus, it makes the ""should I lease or buy"" question an easier comparison, since the terms are equal. You just end up at 3 years with a paid off car worth whatever you can get for it, vs. nothing! Right now, just based on Edmunds, even though i only put ~ $1,000 down on it, I am pretty much even on it.

doing some quick math, and estimating a very aggressive lease payment (I never actual ask for a lease quote when I was buying), I am paying about $100/month more on the loan, so about $3,600 over the life of the loan. Adding that to the principal balance after 36 payments, and adjusting for the tax and DMV due at the end of a lease (to buy out), my purchase is roughly equivalent to if I had leased it and was able to buy it at the end for ~ $11,500. Pretty sure a low mile, pristine Sport should be worth more than that at the time (or at least, would have trouble finding a better car deal for that money!) And that the residual on a lease would be higher.

It was a very tough day as it was totally unexpected and the circumstances (I won't go into the details) were fairly gruesome. If there is anything good that happened, it was that I discovered him in distress around 2:15PM and immediately called his vet. They closed at 2:00 but there vet who had been treating him was still there closing up, saw my name come up on the phone, and answered. After a short discussion she had me bring him in even though she had no help there. She stayed with me there until almost 4:00 there dealing with things. She could just as easily not bothered to answer the phone.

@bwia, she offered me a few options. Most are cremated these days here. I chose not to have the ashes returned.

One question I do have is the last payment slip in the book says ""call for final payment"". Is that normal? Since the dealer set up the financing and beat my credit union by a little bit I wonder if there were some shenanigans in the fine print that I missed.

I think that is normal (or at least not unusual). To double check that, check the last payment due notice that you got in the mail. There should be a ""payoff balance"" on that sheet of paper. A quick bit of math, and you should know for sure if everything is kosher.

One of my friends asked me if I subscribed to Netflix - and my response was that I do. He suggested I go on to Netflix and search for one of their short series entitled, ""ATYPICAL"". It is a 6 part series about a high school teenager who suffers from autism - probably with Asperger's Syndrome. It is a comedy drama series about the frustrations the boy experiences - like taking verbal comments made to him ""literally"" rather than figuratively. It includes his interactions with other 17 and 18 year olds, his mother and father, his sister and the family as a whole and how they deal with life.

I found it one of the very best series I have ever viewed. I laughed at the various situations he gets himself in and out of. My eyes teared at his frustrations and insecurities. I empathized with the parents as well as sister.

It is unbelievably well acted by all characters. It's a must see if you want some good laughs and some serious knowledge about these neurological disorders from the perspective of the boy, the parents, the sister and all tose he comes into contact with.

In the last episode, it seems as if there will be another 7-8 episodes based upon the way it ended.

4675,July 15,abacomike,"I posted a couple of times in the last few weeks about the fiasco with ""SUNPASS"", the system the State of Florida uses to collect tolls on all of its toll roads using a transponder. Well, finally, they got their website and mobile App working as of yesterday. I checked all the tolls they charged against my account and I noticed all of June and most of July tolls have not been billed. Why? Because their multi-million dollar system crashed the first day they implemented it back at the beginning of June. So, I estimated that I spent about $30 using the Turnpike the past 6 weeks that will not be collected or charged because of the ""technical"" issues with the new system. I wonder how many millions of dollars the Toll Road Administration will have lost over this mess. Astonishing that the media did not get a hold of this for those 6 weeks - they seem to cover just about everything else - how come not one media outlet (newspapers, TV, Radio) covered this?

Trying driving on the back streets of Palermo Sicily some day. One time I had to ask people to move their lunch table, and another time I ended up going down a small flight of stairs! Geez, did I feel stupid doing that. Never trust a GPS when the scale is under a few hundred yards, in a European city.
In Ontario we were going from Niagara to Niagara on the lake to tour wineries. Our GPS actually took us on a large loop bringing us back to our starting point before directing us to our location. On the way back it told us to make a left turn and as I was about to turn I saw that the road was a narrow dirt road and I said ""nope"" and we straight and let the GPS recalculate the route.

Why am I not surprised that you don't understand the maniac part. Everyone has someplace to be, most people plan accordingly. my ego isn't hurt by someone passing me either, it's just that I don't understand the mentality that going faster saves so much time when in reality it doesn't ( especially in heavy rush hour traffic). 

The average commute in the US is just over 25 minutes, only a small percentage have 30 miles or more to commute. My 12.5 mile commute comes in at about that 25 minute time. Now if the two of us drive that commute at the same time with you going as fast as you can and me doing speed limit I will guarentee you that after 11.5 miles you will be able to see me in your rearview mirror. 

As for the lights, the ones you can make by speeding I will also make doing speed limit. The lights I will get caught by so will you, you will just get to them sooner. Those lights you usually have to sit through at least one cycle before getting through.

Seriously the only way that I can make this commute any faster is by leaving a lot earlier or by taking my motorcycle and split lanes. Try this, drive your commute and don't exceed the speed limit and see how much time you really save.

There is a flaw with the Solomon curve, that is it didn't take into account accidents involving vehicles that had slowed down to negotiate a turn. Subsequent studies have supported Solomon but several (I will try to find one) found that around 45% of ""slower"" moving vehicles were originally traveling with or above the flow of traffic and had only slowed down to turn off the road. When they adjusted their findings for this the bottom of that curve moves away from that slightly faster than average that you proport.

Unfortunately a highway can only accommodate a finite number of cars and still maintain a smooth flow of traffic. During rush hour far more cars attempt to use highways than they can accommodate at a normal flow. This slows down traffic sometimes to a crawl with all lanes filled doing very close to the same speed. In this situation would you ticket all the thousands of cars? To do so would make the situation worse.

They are the ones who aggressively switch lanes to the right and sometimes meet a driver merging left from lane 1 into #2, e.g..

I used to have to drive into Cincinnati for medical visits monthly for a time and I loved setting the appointment at 9:00 or so meaning I would get to drive 55 or 60 in the rightmost lane of 3 and more with the trucks and others. But I watched the other drivers in the then 3 lane interstate jockey for their ego positions in the traffic filling the 3 lanes where a lot of folks from Dayton area commute southward to Middletown and Cincinnati.

The folks who were truly in a hurry didn't spend time trying to bolster their ego by tailgating someone going 69 in traffic in the leftmost lane of 3 or 4. They carefully passed on the right if they thought there were enough spacing there to get around the errant driver in the left most lane.

If a driver was in the leftmost lane going below the speed limit, all bets were off.

Note, there is traffic in the 1 and 2 lanes to my right, sometimes with trucks who are speed limited to 60 or 63. Note, I get over when there is a long space where I don't have to make a lane change back left to be able to keep my speed above the limit. OR this is through the 3 miles or so of urban Dayton traffic.

I also noted before I traded it for the Malibu that driving my leSabre, the 03 red one, also made me a target for more aggressive tailgating. The FOP and NRA stickers on the rear window didn't seem to slow down the stereotyping that a Buick driver was different than an Accord or Civic driver.

Does the car being driven by the smaller percentage of aggressive drivers make a difference?

Yes and yes. Many young gods in cars that were somewhat spec'd up, usually with wings and flares. Immortal, superior, absolutely unconcerned about safety of their own and others. Then I saw even more of those who would weave back and forth with ""some"" consideration in a fairly crowded place (I mean all three lanes loaded with cars going 60-70 mph, sometimes more with majority of drivers observing reasonable distances between each other considering the speed. Those were usually ""normal"" cars, driven by a bit larger group of driver gods of different age and gender, also convinced that the world would come to absolute end if they had to drive like the rest of us. A gap between two cars going 70 mph meant for them it's something they had a license to go into without any consideration of other peoples' comfort, sense of safety, or simple courtesy. Priority for their time, superiority of their skills and inferiority of everybody else's was written in the Bible and Constitution. There are times, unfortunately, when your posts give me (perhaps mistaken) impression that you are a member of that club, or perhaps even a founder of a local chapter. I can be wrong, though...
Nah, I'm much tamer on 2 and 3 lane roads than the 4, 5, and 6 lane wide freeways I'm on every day. With so many lanes available to me, it is quite easy to both weave and be safe and considerate to others.

However, I often have to wonder why someone that is part of slower traffic (and I don't just mean compared to me, but many others as well) thinks it's OK to be 4 lanes away from where they should be. My conclusion is brain dead; zombies.

It's bad enough the truckers avoid the right-most lane, mostly probably due to bad merges by bad drivers. Still, they are only 1 lane away from where they should be... how does one explain being 4 lanes over with no other traffic around them? I need to get a dash cam and post some greatest hits.

What I'm doing must be working, because unlike @graphicguy I may get the tickets, but I'm not getting into any accidents, especially at-fault accidents. All the near misses tend to happen at 0-10 MPH too.

For those that say speeders are so dangerous they will eventually impede traffic... I've been driving nearly 25 years now, just when will I cause a wreck that impedes traffic?

Are there any here that consider all rear-end collisions unsafe speed violations? I view them as failure to yield errors usually due to distraction. You can rear-end someone at 1 MPH.

@imidazol97 ...a rural area not far from me is going bankrupt because the courts ruled red light cameras were unconstitutional. The town is called New Miami which is about 15 miles from me. It's a small town....about 2,000 population. The revenues they derived from the red light cameras totaled about $3M. It had been operating for a few years.

As a result, millions of dollars from the red light camera need to be refunded to whomever paid the fines. That amount would set the area into bankruptcy since they increased spending significantly in anticipation of the red light camera windfall. Guess they didn't save up for that eventuality .

Last I heard, given the red light manufacturer shared in the profits, the town was trying to tie them in to share the refund burden since they also shared the profits. The manufacturer told the city they could not afford to share the burden without going bankrupt themselves.

The court ruling has most of the areas around me backing off of red light cameras.

Government officials responsible for these cameras should be tried and convicted of HIGH TREASON to the United States of America!

About 20 years ago, I was sitting in a line of traffic, waiting on a red light. The car behind me bumped into me, and stayed in contact. A very slight bump, no damage, but a little weird. I got out of my car, checked for damage, of which there was none as our bumpers did line up. I walked back to speak to the driver. He was unresponsive, would not acknowledge me. Staring straight ahead, not moving. But his face was pale, and sweaty.

By this time the light had changed, people were honking their horns, and I was really unsure what to do. I couldn’t just drive off, my car was the only thing holding his car in place. I wasn’t sure whether we needed an ambulance or a LEO or both. Fortunately, a police car came along and I was able to flag him down. He opened the door, put the car in park, turned off the ignition, and called for an ambulance. I never did find out whether the guy was sick or drugged, but he was completely unresponsive through all of this. Eyes open, but unresponsive. Definitely a weird experience.

I suppose, my tax money paid for those lanes after all. My borrowing them for a few seconds doesn't slow anyone down or put anyone out. This only works if the lane is wide open in the ""open/merging"" section, which of course is why there are no double yellows.

I just don't feel safe behind an LLC. I either have to move right, pass right, or preferably, pass left. Even worse, if someone is an LLC, I consider them to likely be a reckless driver, so I don't want to be anywhere near them any longer than I have to be.

Often was the wrong word choice though. I would say this is seldomly required. On occassion. Once in a while.

So you are in Knightsbridge? The American Community School that I attended was near Harrods and that was the tube station I commuted from. Dad's office was in Wimbledon and we lived in Oxshott, Surrey. That was in 1974-75. Enjoy!
That is cool sda. Yes, we are on the street that runs behind Harrods. Harrods and Selfridge are extremely expensive stores to shop in, and they are packed. Things are booming here. Cranes and new buildings going up everywhere. Now I see what they are trying to do to our cities back home. Make driving impossible, and cities are for pedestrians, bikes, taxis and busses.

I'd be more OK with a speed tax than the current farce masquerading as safety.

Also, if is point A to point B time based speed tax, there are other ways to not cross the finish line too soon to trigger any red flags.
Yeah, I agree. I do recall going through Ohio or Indiana on I-90 a while ago, which is a toll road. They actually had signs up that noted you would pay a higher toll if you reached up-road toll stations too quickly. I don't recall the thresholds, but it was reasonably generous.

I suppose, my tax money paid for those lanes after all. My borrowing them for a few seconds doesn't slow anyone down or put anyone out. This only works if the lane is wide open in the ""open/merging"" section, which of course is why there are no double yellows.

I just don't feel safe behind an LLC. I either have to move right, pass right, or preferably, pass left. Even worse, if someone is an LLC, I consider them to likely be a reckless driver, so I don't want to be anywhere near them any longer than I have to be.

Often was the wrong word choice though. I would say this is seldomly required. On occassion. Once in a while.
Last time we were driving through the Portland (OR) area, nearly every single vehicle in the ""HOV"" lane had only one occupant. I actually left that lane because it was moving more slowly than the standard left lane. Plus, mine seemed to be the only car with multiple people in it (in the HOV lane), and I felt less annoyed not driving with all those other entitled yahoos.

I never understood that law, and I'd be curious to see when it is enforced. NJ has both no pass on right AND keep right except to pass laws.

4838,July 11,abacomike,"About a week ago, I mentioned that the upgrade to the “SunPass” system here in Florida had failed and crashed back on June 1st resulting in a few million SunPass transponder owners being unable to determine what tolls were paid and what their balances were in their accounts because the website and mobile APP are inoperative.  Well, according to an email I received last week, I was supposed to be able to retrieve my balance and get copies of my paid tolls starting Sunday.  Today is Wednesday and still no available data or info.

So I decided to call SunPass operations this morning.  I was told I should have been able to retrieve the info.  I told her no.  My account is still showing no tolls and the same balance I had on May 27th.  She checked and verified that my account, and the accounts of several million others, have not yet become available with current data.

I’m a patient man, but this is pathetic.  All they do is give out press releases that are positive so the media stays off their back, but nothing changes.  I haven’t seen one article in the newspaper about this fiasco nor have I seen anything on the evening local news about it.  Their public relations representative has done a marvelous job of squelching this.  I contacted the Governors office and they played dumb with me over the phone - like, “...oh, we thought everything was back to normal...!”  Even the State Government is in cahoots.

Actually, Verizon phones are unlocked due to some kind of FCC settlement (or at least were when iPhone6 and 7 were sold). I used to have iPhone6 with VZ and it was unlocked. It's AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile, who lock their phones, at least until you pay them off (or so I was told). I had to ask Sprint to unlock my current one internationally (and they did). I still owe couple of installments on it, will see if they unlock it after I pay it off.

@imidazol97 ...a rural area not far from me is going bankrupt because the courts ruled red light cameras were unconstitutional. The town is called New Miami which is about 15 miles from me. It's a small town....about 2,000 population. The revenues they derived from the red light cameras totaled about $3M. It had been operating for a few years.

As a result, millions of dollars from the red light camera need to be refunded to whomever paid the fines. That amount would set the area into bankruptcy since they increased spending significantly in anticipation of the red light camera windfall. Guess they didn't save up for that eventuality .

Last I heard, given the red light manufacturer shared in the profits, the town was trying to tie them in to share the refund burden since they also shared the profits. The manufacturer told the city they could not afford to share the burden without going bankrupt themselves.

The court ruling has most of the areas around me backing off of red light cameras.

I think I mentioned before that a local city installed red light cameras with the expectation of big rewards only to have people stop running them. The city had to give ALL the revenue to the camera company. Cheesed off the electorate something fierce. If this hadn't been a one party town for the last hundred years it might have led to a regime change.

Some quick thoughts on my rental vehicle this week while the Acura gets fixed. Enterprise gave me a FWD 2017 Chevy Equinox and it definitely doesn't have me running to the Chevy dealer with my checkbook. The steering is numb and overboosted, the 4 cylinder feels overtaxed, and I can't seem to find a very comfortable driving position. Handling is also middling at best, even for a car based CUV (IMO). 33K hard miles may also have something to do with it as the car is fairly beat up on the sight with scratches, small dents, and scuffs on the wheels. The controls are immediately recognizable as GM (it looks like a friends older Terrain) but they are relatively straightforward and all fall easily within my reach. Also a lot of hard plastics as well on the surfaces that you see/touch the most.

I have to assume this is the base model, which was still fairly well equipped with all power equipment, satellite radio, heated cloth seats, etc and that the higher trims with the 6 cylinder and presumably more luxurious touches may change my opinion.
It surprised me that Enterprise has other trim levels besides base for their cars. Some of the small puddle jumpers are like plastic toys. Other, like the Caddie wagon thing (CTS?) I drove this week are very plush inside. Mid range cars like the Nissan Altima come in at least 3 trim levels.

I think the proof is in the pudding. When I was 16 until I was about 30, I had amassed enough traffic violations and fender benders to keep the traffic courts awash in Benjamins.

I think I single handedly kept one particular repair shop in business and probably sent the owner on a cruise at least once per year. If it weren’t for a family lawyer, I may have had spent time incarcerated.

However, as these things go, the older and more experienced I got, the fewer infractions (and accidents) I had. I have not had a ticket, nor an accident charged to me in 25 years.

Kinda proud of that. But, I don’t think I’ve slowed down any. Probably much better at paying attention and missing other cars on the road. I now know where the speed traps are (and yes, even the ones tracked by air). I now know when the local constanbulary is out in fore, and where. I can now recognize, and keep my distance from, driving idiots.

The last encounter I had was a few years ago where some old dude was doing 15MPH in a 40 MPH zone. I flashed him a couple of times, which caused him to slow down to 10 MPH. I tried to pass him on the left, legally, which caused him to drift to the left to keep me from passing. Finally, I actually passed him illegally on the right as he was clearly stupid, on drugs or drunk. Unfortunately, there was a local cop a few cars behind who observed the whole thing. He lit up both of us.

Long and short of it, the guy was on drugs (middle of the day) and pretty obstinate with the cop. He was cuffed. I was allowed to go my merry way with a stern warning.

If you know where you’re going, if traffic warrants it, if you’re familar with the roads, then I flaunt the speed limit quite often, and usually well in excess of what’s customary. I’m always aware of the possibility of police trying to add to the locale’s coffers, so am cautious around areas that look like perfect places for police to hide, and to markings on the road where someone above could clock me.

What I think is extremely dangerous are cops who hide at night, with their lights off, pulled ver on a berm or a median. They can’t be seen, are trying to hide (assuming on purpose so they can’t be discovered until the last minute) in order to catch scofflaws. This is a very dangerous and unnecessary practice.

My other pet peeve, DUI check points. I don’t drink and drive, period. I think the check points are a terrible waste of money for very little ROI. If someone is stupid enough to get caught drunk at a check point, it shouldn’t be too difficult to nail them without the checkpoint. And, the habitual offenders, the ones the cops already know about, are easy enough to find.

Take that funding, go after the much, much bigger menace.....texting and driving.

(he drove a grungy Malibu wagon and a Cavalier, so his fear may have been well founded).
Maybe Roadburner can speak to the techniques used by the redlight/speed camera companies to get local authorities to use their products to ""make the public safe."" A few years back Columbus had some of its officials investigated for accepting ""favors"" from those honest, law-loving companies (from other countries).

Our local example of a deteriorated government in Dayton went back to putting officers out with a speed gun camera to issue tickets without stopping those terrible desperados going 8 over the limit. That's instead of pursuing and stopping the cars, where they might find the all too common no driver license, no insurance valid, drunk or under influence of other drugs, warrants for the driver and/or passengers, no valid license plate on the car, usw.

Dayton also turned back on their money-making red light cameras in certain locations after the Supreme Court had reversed some requirements making it next to impossible for locals to use these moneymakers.

Also City of Dayton declared they couldn't have their officers spending time making traffic stops. It wasn't safe. I don't find a link but it was within the last 6 months or so.

Just a question, have you ever seen someone weave through multiple lanes of freeway with no letting up with no other cars around? And if so,any that were not drunk?

I think the answer shows what we all know, that weaving is a reaction to a cause. We just don't want to acknowledge the real cause sometimes. It's easier to blame the effect than the cause.

I personally, blame the cause, and it's traffic impeders.
Yes and yes. Many young gods in cars that were somewhat spec'd up, usually with wings and flares. Immortal, superior, absolutely unconcerned about safety of their own and others. Then I saw even more of those who would weave back and forth with ""some"" consideration in a fairly crowded place (I mean all three lanes loaded with cars going 60-70 mph, sometimes more with majority of drivers observing reasonable distances between each other considering the speed. Those were usually ""normal"" cars, driven by a bit larger group of driver gods of different age and gender, also convinced that the world would come to absolute end if they had to drive like the rest of us. A gap between two cars going 70 mph meant for them it's something they had a license to go into without any consideration of other peoples' comfort, sense of safety, or simple courtesy.

Staring straight ahead, not moving. But his face was pale, and sweaty.

I wasn’t sure whether we needed an ambulance or a LEO or both. Fortunately, a police car came along and I was able to flag him down. He opened the door, put the car in park, turned off the ignition, and called for an ambulance. I never did find out whether the guy was sick or drugged, but he was completely unresponsive through all of this. Eyes open, but unresponsive. Definitely a weird experience.

Handling is also middling at best, even for a car based CUV (IMO). 33K hard miles may also have something to do with it as the car is fairly beat up on the sight with scratches, small dents, and scuffs on the wheels. The controls are immediately recognizable as GM (it looks like a friends older Terrain) but they are relatively straightforward and all fall easily within my reach. Also a lot of hard plastics as well on the surfaces that you see/touch the most.

I have to assume this is the base model, which was still fairly well equipped with all power equipment, satellite radio, heated cloth seats, etc and that the higher trims with the 6 cylinder and presumably more luxurious touches may change my opinion.

The result does not surprise me. It's not about driving ""too fast"". It's about driving like a moron - cutting people off, distracted, not paying attention, lane encroachment, etc. Either through recklessness (I'm more important than you), or lack of focus (I can't be bothered, I have to look at this text message), or lack of skill (what's does this lever do?). Combine that with high speed, over or under the limit and you get death of the innocent as often as the guilty. Speed limits are aimed to reduce catastrophic nature of accidents that occur from those other primary reasons. Driving too slow is a real problem, but number of such people is (by my completely unscientific observation) much smaller than driving too fast (or whatever you call it). If we ALL drove slower, accidents would have been less deadly (even if they might be more frequent in some circumstances). I'm not advocating for that all, as there is a practical limit and proper risk-to-reward aspect of allowing higher speeds, but it's a fact.
I see recklessness as more of a symptom stemming from ignorance, lack of experience, and road rage/anger of course.

If people knew the Solomon Curve for instance, I think you'd have less people deciding to ""park it"" on the shoulder of a high-speed freeway when it's foggy.

This is why young people are so susceptible to cell phone distractions; they lack the experience to know that kind of distraction has an unacceptable risk associated with it. Education helps, but so does experience.

You know what causes an unusual amount of deaths? Not wearing your seat belt. The laws have worked on that, compliance is extremely high. A very small percentage disobey seat belt laws. However, that very small percentage that disobey seat belt laws really get more than their fair share of fatalities. Maybe ""fair"" isn't the right word here. They disproportionately expose themselves to hazards, which I think if they knew the stats, they wouldn't take the risks.

I’ve been reading the last several pages of posts regarding speed of vehicles on interstates or highways.  I’m having a problem wrapping my head around the rationale(s) proffered for driving significantly over the speed limit.

I drive a 10 mile round trip segment of the Florida Turnpike just about every morning and I fail to understand why drivers are going 75-80 mph in moderate traffic, zig-zagging in and out of the 3 traffic lanes.  The speed limit is 65 mph, but I can agree that 70 mph is an acceptable stretch of that 65 mph limit.  

I drive a car that would have no difficulty running at 90 mph safely on any well-paved multi-lane Highway, but why would I want to do 90, or 80 or even 75 in a 65 zone?  Unless all the traffic is moving at high speed as on the German Autobon, it is irresponsible to jeopardize the lives of drivers observing the speed limit or 5 mph over the speed limit.  

To take the psition that a driver can travel 15-20 mph over a posted speed limit because he or she “can” is dangerous and very suspect!  I see it every day on the Turnpike.  When I drive up to see my brother near Jacksonville, I drive at a steady 75 mph on roads that have a posted 70 mph limit.  Why is it necessary to drive at 80 or 85 mph?  It places all drivers on the road in jeopardy due to inconsiderate speeders.

If I lived in Montana, The Dakota’s or other rural areas of rural States where there is no posted speed limit, I might consider going 80 or 90 mph so long as all the traffic was moving at that speed.  But I refuse to place my life and the lives of others in jeopardy because of speeds significantly above the posted limit.

Question 1) How long has it been since you've been to CA? I have the lemmings here trained to do 80-85 routinely in 65 zones. Of course, with 5 lanes of width, you can have plenty of separation for those that go slower.

Question 2) Can you accept that many might find 75-80 to be a perfectly acceptable speed in moderate traffic despite the low 65 MPH speed limit? Not everyone will ever agree on the right speed, and that's why we have passing lanes.

Question 3) You do realize the Autobahn does have slower traffic, including trucks? The difference is they keep right except to pass; that's all. Germans are not genetically superior human drivers. They are not born that way. The system works. It's not theory; it's been practiced and proven to work in the real-world.

Question 4) How do speed deltas of 20 MPH or less really jeopardize lives? Does everyone here realize that the force of a collision between an Audi doing 120 MPH and a BMW doing 100 MPH is the same as the 20 MPH moving Prius rear-ending you at a red-light that you are stopped at? Okay, assuming the Prius was just as heavy.

Just my thoughts for the day. I think minor speed deltas can coexist safely in an orderly driving world.

Unfortunately we disagree again. And I'm pretty Libertarian, but here's why your 100% wrong:

1) Competent, reasonable, and prudent people expect you to be able to maintain control and execute mitigating maneuvers in an emergency situation, a situation that might involve impacts. Yes, collisions, plural. The first hit might not be the hardest or most deadly!

2) How in the world are you going to maintain reasonable driver control over your vehicle if you are KNOCKED OUT OF YOUR SEAT because your too stupid to wear a seat belt.(not you personally, but for those that would do so).

3) An example would be if someone hit you, and knocked you over a cliff because you couldn't be bothered to touch the brakes or turn the steering wheel because your head is halfway through the windshield. Not so bad if they are by themselves? What if they have kids in the back seat? What if they hit another car and take them over the cliff with them?

4) I'm afraid the seat belt is pretty much as important as anything to keep you in a position to effect movement and control over your vehicle. This is something I probably didn't realize to the extent I have until HPDE training. You are in control of a 3,000+ pound object traveling potentially at high speeds, I think it is fair of society to ask that you take precautions to remain in control of it in less than ideal circumstances.

5) What about unnecessary medical bills society has to pay for because someone chose no seat belt or no helmet?

The result does not surprise me. It's not about driving ""too fast"". It's about driving like a moron - cutting people off, distracted, not paying attention, lane encroachment, etc. Either through recklessness (I'm more important than you), or lack of focus (I can't be bothered, I have to look at this text message), or lack of skill (what's does this lever do?). Combine that with high speed, over or under the limit and you get death of the innocent as often as the guilty. Speed limits are aimed to reduce catastrophic nature of accidents that occur from those other primary reasons. Driving too slow is a real problem, but number of such people is (by my completely unscientific observation) much smaller than driving too fast (or whatever you call it). If we ALL drove slower, accidents would have been less deadly (even if they might be more frequent in some circumstances). I'm not advocating for that all, as there is a practical limit and proper risk-to-reward aspect of allowing higher speeds, but it's a fact.
If the frequency of collisions goes up (rate up), and people are still dying, it would be possible deaths would not go down.

For example, a reduced speed might lower the fatality per collision rate, but if collisions rise too high it could more than offset that rate decrease. The problem with speed limits is they are not that effective at controlling driving/travel speeds.

My opinion is simple, we know other cultures get better results than our USA experiment on driving, why not model the better systems?

To be fair, you are unlikely to take out other innocent victims with your Big Macs. I can see scenarios where accidents are deadly or not deadly to the driver not wearing a seat belt, but result in someone else, another innocent victim being involved, injured, or killed because of a minor accident that caused unbolted driver to lose control because they were not buckled up.

I'd give this slow guy a pass if his target was the next exit. It's safer for him (and rest of us, too) to limp for a few miles and get off at a controlled access point (if he can) than stop altogether at a random location. On the other hand, the ""immortal"", who makes no mistakes, driving and weaving at 20 mph higher, convinced that normal rules of traffic and laws of physics don't apply to him, is the one that is more dangerous, as he/she will do it for miles and miles with no intention to let up.
Just a question, have you ever seen someone weave through multiple lanes of freeway with no letting up with no other cars around? And if so,any that were not drunk?

I think the answer shows what we all know, that weaving is a reaction to a cause. We just don't want to acknowledge the real cause sometimes. It's easier to blame the effect than the cause.

I am sure roadburner can explain the legal technicalities involved.
Lots of states don't treat speeding and other minor infractions as criminal cases, meaning that the constitutional safeguards don't apply. The goal is revenue collection.

In Kentucky you can still request a jury trial for any traffic infraction, and the fines and the majority of court costs go to the state- meaning there is no financial incentive to convict.

When I was a judge in traffic court I was the toughest on the defendants who were speeding in active school zones or construction zones, as well as congested residential streets. That said, I didn't think a guy going 100 mph on a deserted interstate at 3:00 AM was a big deal.

My chief traffic prosecutor-who shared my philosophy-had a Mustang GT and an extremely heavy right foot; she also wound up being elected judge. She replaced a guy who thought that you risked certain death if you drove 1 mph over 55(he drove a grungy Malibu wagon and a Cavalier, so his fear may have been well founded).

And she and I both believed that anyone caught camping out in the left lane should be sentenced to life without the possibility of parole.

4915,July 11,cdnpinhead,"This interminable back-and-forth regarding driving over the speed limit and/or hogging the left lane makes it quite apparent that most of the people on here live in crowded metro areas and get little or no opportunity to drive on uncrowded rural roads. Go west, young (or otherwise) man, but not too far -- the Pacific states suck close to the coast, but not so much a bit East.

Either way, my policy (FWIW) is to go with the flow of traffic, even if it's 15 mph over the limit or five below -- to do otherwise is more trouble than it's worth, in my world. All the lanes are full -- calm down and listen to your audio system.

When there is no other traffic visible, go for it. Set the cruise control at 105 (some of the new ones don't even allow this) and drive for a half hour (in rural [yeah, I know is there anything else] New Mexico) on a Sunday morning.

Lastly, weaving is a symptom of a disease. That disease is left lane camping. Eradicating left lane camping makes weaving extinct, among many other undesirable behaviors.

Speed differential hazards are almost wiped out if you have lane discipline and strict adherence to passing laws. The reason speed differentials are so hazardous in the USA is because of our poor adherence to lane laws as a group of people.
No, not true. Or at the very least, not universally true. My morning commute takes me up the 288 Freeway, which then splits into I45 and I69. The left 2 lanes go into I45 for a short run, which then splits between Northbound and Southbound.

The rightmost lane goes into I69 South. The next lane over (second from the right) goes into I69 North. People who want to wind up on I45 Northbound, and know what they're doing, get in the left most lane a good mile or two before the split. Some mornings, I45 is backed up and the left two lanes of 288 are slower than the right two lanes. Some morning, I69 is backed up and the right two lanes of 288 are slower.

The ""hurry hurry hurry, beat everyone to work by 2 minutes"" crowd go plowing through traffic, jumping lanes, trying to get a 1 car advantage. They disrupt traffic flow for everyone, and cause the majority of accidents that I have seen in my 8 years of commuting on this route.

Now when I set out for San Antonio ( a 3 hour drive), I do get annoyed at left lane campers. There is a stretch of about 100 miles in there with nothing, and I do mean nothing. Just a divided interstate highway, 2 lanes westbound, 2 lanes eastbound. When I get caught behind 2 cars side by side doing 65, when the majority of the cars want to move at around 75 to 80, yes, that is annoying. But there is no ""weaving"", there is no way to weave, no place to weave.

And I will repeat my initial statement: If you are driving 20 mph faster than the average of the traffic around you, YOU are a danger, to yourself and others. And that is NOT the fault of left lane campers.

But you called the ""hurry hurry 20 over"" speeders a ""crowd"" Isn't fair to say if they are a crowd, perhaps the average is only 10 below them, not 20? We're not talking lone wolf are we?

Let's concede for a moment that going 10-20 over the adjacent lane is a danger. Even so, does forcing them to weave right to pass sound like a good solution? That just makes the fastest traffic interact more closely with the slowest traffic. This is why we have left/right driving conventions in the first place. A camper is MAXIMIZING speed differentials, while a speeder is only doing whatever differential they prefer to do.

What you describe with multiple freeways going multiple directions all in a tiny space is pretty rare. I know LA has that with the I5 north.

The worst thing you can do is force a ""bozo"" or whatever name-calling you wish to apply (maniac?) to the right to pass slower traffic on the left. Slow pokes obeying the law in the correct and right lane will be just as mad at you as the maniacs. Every time I witness a left lane impediment violation/infraction, the offending vehicle could have EASILY moved right to allow passing. I just never see that ultra rare occurrence where someone is passing a long line of trucks at a delta of 5 with no room to move right, and the guy behind is just being an impatient maniac. That's just NOT what I'm observing out there, the vast majority of the time.

The truth is the slower pokes will REACT EXACTLY like a super speeder to being impeded in the passing lane. It's human nature. Slower pokes get impeded by the slowest pokes. Mild speeders get impeded by speed limit abiders, and so on and so forth. We all react the same to that, and we all will pass on the right when impeded like that.

The ""everyone else is doing it"" excuse to impede traffic is not a defense, anymore than it works for speeding. Not to mention the traffic is being generated by traffic impeders in the first place. So they create the situation, and then want you to be happy suffering from the situation they created? Not going to happen.

Just keep right except to pass, it makes law enforcement's job easier to pick off the speeders.

I usually conclude that someone was on their cell phone or other distraction because I don't understand how you rear-end a car going the same direction as everyone on the freeway.

Every time I witness a left lane impediment violation/infraction, the offending vehicle could have EASILY moved right to allow passing. I just never see that ultra rare occurrence where someone is passing a long line of trucks at a delta of 5 with no room to move right, and the guy behind is just being an impatient maniac. That's just NOT what I'm observing out there, the vast majority of the time.

The truth is the slower pokes will REACT EXACTLY like a super speeder to being impeded in the passing lane. It's human nature. Slower pokes get impeded by the slowest pokes. Mild speeders get impeded by speed limit abiders, and so on and so forth. We all react the same to that, and we all will pass on the right when impeded like that.

The ""everyone else is doing it"" excuse to impede traffic is not a defense, anymore than it works for speeding. Not to mention the traffic is being generated by traffic impeders in the first place. So they create the situation, and then want you to be happy suffering from the situation they created? Not going to happen.

Just keep right except to pass, it makes law enforcement's job easier to pick off the speeders.
Tell yourself whatever you want. I also like to go fast sometimes, sometimes I go faster than the speed limit. We all do. Oh, my.... I'm not in ""speed kills"" camp at all, but I just grew tired of reading incessant fast-and-safe-no-matter-what-the-facts-I-have-my-own-statistics posts, I just had to say something.

Just out of curiosity, how many accidents have you witnessed in real time on this route. I think a fair question, as I can probably count the amount of accidents I've seen on one or two hands in real-time.

Or are you just projecting your biases with a conclusion of fault based on only seeing the wreckage? I usually conclude that someone was on their cell phone or other distraction because I don't understand how you rear-end a car going the same direction as everyone on the freeway. I suppose you could be cut-off in a manner by an unsafe lane change that makes a rear-end collision inevitable. Good reason to get a dash cam.
A fair question. Accidents that I have seen happen, on that particular route, during the last 8 years -- probably 5 or 6. To the best of my memory, two were rear enders and the rest were side collisions. Mostly happens when 2 cars try to move into a hole in the traffic, one from the right, one from the left. And during that same 8 years, I have seen literally hundreds of near misses from that scenario.

Now there have been quite a few more where I did not see the crash-bam-boom, but did see the aftermath. And if the damage is primarily to the sides of the cars (not limited to front and rear), I make the assumption it was due to lane changing.

Don't get me wrong, I am not some ""never exceed the speed limit"" type. Give me a nice open highway, no traffic (or very light traffic), dry conditions, excellent visibility, and I am very likely going to exceed the speed limit. Sometimes by 20 or 30 mph or even more.

But not in traffic. The more traffic, the more we all need to go with the flow. I'm sorry if you don't like it. This is much like the other discussion about noisy neighbors. If you don't want to put up with noisy neighbors, move to the country and buy yourself 5 acres. But if you're like most of us, you have to live in the city in order to make a living. And deal with occasionally noisy neighbors, and bad traffic on a regular daily basis.

All the hypotheticals about the virtues of fast, aggressive driving made me recall that most accidents are caused by fast drivers wanting to get somewhere faster and disrupting the smooth flow of traffic causing accidents.

That makes sense. I haven't seen side swipes but I have seen near-misses a lot. This is exactly why I rail against left lane camping. These simultaneous lane changes happen directly because someone is forcing passes on the right, while the slowest traffic is being passed on the left. This is exactly where those greater speed differentials come into play. Middle lane campers force passes on both sides of them in 4+ lane highways. If all passes were on the left, traffic just becomes so much more predictable and safe. Lane changes for the most part, cease to be a hazardous event.

I'm not the fastest car out there. I like to stay around the 85th percentile. OK, maybe 90%. So that still means there are faster cars than me out there regularly, and the last thing I want is to be surprised by them because of a Prius in the left lane. Forcing passes to the right goes against nature! I'm not bothered by someone going faster than me. It really is no skin off my back!

I just don't see anything positive resulting from traffic being slowed down and forced right. You'll always have people assuming ""you're all just a bunch of IDIOTS!"" for going so slow. I maintain the best way to avoid high congestion is to allow free flowing traffic.

I'm going to let out a speeder's secret.... after weaving carefully and safely in and around a dozen or more cars, you are often rewarded with a good stretch of open highway, 1/2 mile, 3/4/ of a mile, maybe even multiple miles. This happens even in LA of all places. Traffic often moves in pockets, even in very high congestion. I look at these pockets as solar system or galaxy clusters. There's a lot of space in between.

The result does not surprise me. It's not about driving ""too fast"". It's about driving like a moron - cutting people off, distracted, not paying attention, lane encroachment, etc. Either through recklessness (I'm more important than you), or lack of focus (I can't be bothered, I have to look at this text message), or lack of skill (what's does this lever do?). Combine that with high speed, over or under the limit and you get death of the innocent as often as the guilty. Speed limits are aimed to reduce catastrophic nature of accidents that occur from those other primary reasons. Driving too slow is a real problem, but number of such people is (by my completely unscientific observation) much smaller than driving too fast (or whatever you call it). If we ALL drove slower, accidents would have been less deadly (even if they might be more frequent in some circumstances). I'm not advocating for that all, as there is a practical limit and proper risk-to-reward aspect of allowing higher speeds, but it's a fact.

Now that the speed limits on limited access roads are usually 70 mph or better, I still drive 80-85, it's a comfortable speed that doesn't attract the attention of law enforcement- especially since I'm usually far from the fastest car on the road.

I’ve been reading the last several pages of posts regarding speed of vehicles on interstates or highways.  I’m having a problem wrapping my head around the rationale(s) proffered for driving significantly over the speed limit.

I drive a 10 mile round trip segment of the Florida Turnpike just about every morning and I fail to understand why drivers are going 75-80 mph in moderate traffic, zig-zagging in and out of the 3 traffic lanes.  The speed limit is 65 mph, but I can agree that 70 mph is an acceptable stretch of that 65 mph limit.  

I drive a car that would have no difficulty running at 90 mph safely on any well-paved multi-lane Highway, but why would I want to do 90, or 80 or even 75 in a 65 zone?  Unless all the traffic is moving at high speed as on the German Autobon, it is irresponsible to jeopardize the lives of drivers observing the speed limit or 5 mph over the speed limit.  

To take the psition that a driver can travel 15-20 mph over a posted speed limit because he or she “can” is dangerous and very suspect!  I see it every day on the Turnpike.  When I drive up to see my brother near Jacksonville, I drive at a steady 75 mph on roads that have a posted 70 mph limit.  Why is it necessary to drive at 80 or 85 mph?  It places all drivers on the road in jeopardy due to inconsiderate speeders.

If I lived in Montana, The Dakota’s or other rural areas of rural States where there is no posted speed limit, I might consider going 80 or 90 mph so long as all the traffic was moving at that speed.  But I refuse to place my life and the lives of others in jeopardy because of speeds significantly above the posted limit.

Mike I just had an idea. Hear me out: How would you like to see your poster buddy and his wife? Since you are willing to lay out $1000 for round trip airfare for your Son and Grandson, spending less than $220 plus baggage fees of $92 for the round trip, you can see us. I just checked and that is the price with Spirit Airlines flying out of Latrobe PA to Fort Lauderdale for the second week in January 2019 till January 28, 2019. I say that is a real bargain especially considering that Mrs. j can cook you up some tasty meals during that period and if you're nice to me I could bring along a bottle of my favorite car wax so that when I have finished doing your car it will be the envy of your complex. Think it over and you'll see that is a great bargain for both of us. jmonroe
So, if I get the gist of your proposal, I just send you about $220 so I can have the distinct pleasure of you and Mrs. jmonroe joining me for a week in this tropical paradise, right?  And, Mrs. jmonroe will cook up a storm in the kitchen while we sit in the dining room and watch her prepare meal after meal, right?

After carefully considering your offer, I PASS!   
Just got back in here after starting to replace the wrought iron railing on the front porch with one of those new fangled white vinyl jobs. No more painting, yippee. It always takes longer than I think it will but I'm pretty much of a perfectionist, got to get it measured out to 1/32 of an inch. Anyway @Mike, you almost got the gist of it.

You haven't debunked it as much as disagreed with it. Time saved by going faster is a function of speed difference and distance, but that doesn't account for traffic, traffic controls and other obstacles. For example, I will be driving to Florida later this month, a drive just over 1,200 miles. Going 1 MPH faster could save me 12 minutes or more, but on my daily commute an additional 1 MPH shortens my drive time by maybe 10 seconds. And that doesn't account for congestion.

In high congestion areas especially in rush hour traffic going faster mostly gets you to the next light faster, not through it faster.

Since the average driver drives less than 50 miles a day on average and a great deal of it in congested areas little time can be saved.

Now for your 5 minutes a day, saved time must be spent when saved or its wasted. If I save $5 a day for 30 days and I would have an extra $150 at the end of the month. If you save 5 minutes a day for 30 days at the end of the month you will not have any extra time.

Don't forget about the times you ""see"" a multi-lane multi-car crash 2 or 3 miles ahead of you, while the speed demon sees it in the rear-view mirror. What's the longest you've spent traveling 2 or 3 miles before?

I can't see time as ever being wasted as I think all speeders have determined that Carlin was right, going slower is idiotic. Therefore, I'd rather watch paint dry and grass grow then be stuck in bumper to bumper traffic.

Let's be serious here, if we both leave from the same place at the same time and I go a reasonable speed and you be a speed demon and I see the accident 2 or 3 miles ahead it will also be ahead of you. Unless the speed difference is extremely high or we are going a very long distance you simply won't get that far ahead of me. And the odds of the accident happening in the short time it takes for me to get there after you is extremely small.

If I am stuck lin bumper to bumper traffic I will be stuck regardless of how fast I went. The only way to avoid that would be to drive when traffic is light. 

Remember what Carlin said about speeders.

The Nissan Sentra idea is still alive and I've got 2 years to start digging several more cars out there, so that's cool.

I would restate that as ""many accidents are caused by drivers not moving with the normal flow"". Too fast or too slow are equally dangerous.

I hate it when I'm moving with the normal flow at 65 mph, and some idiot comes blasting by, weaving in and out of traffic, going 20 mph faster than anyone else. And it is every bit as bad, and dangerous, when you get some idiot driving with his emergency blinkers doing 30 mph in the right hand lane.

Don't forget about the times you ""see"" a multi-lane multi-car crash 2 or 3 miles ahead of you, while the speed demon sees it in the rear-view mirror. What's the longest you've spent traveling 2 or 3 miles before?

I can't see time as ever being wasted as I think all speeders have determined that Carlin was right, going slower is idiotic. Therefore, I'd rather watch paint dry and grass grow then be stuck in bumper to bumper traffic.

Let's be serious here, if we both leave from the same place at the same time and I go a reasonable speed and you be a speed demon and I see the accident 2 or 3 miles ahead it will also be ahead of you. Unless the speed difference is extremely high or we are going a very long distance you simply won't get that far ahead of me. And the odds of the accident happening in the short time it takes for me to get there after you is extremely small.

If I am stuck lin bumper to bumper traffic I will be stuck regardless of how fast I went. The only way to avoid that would be to drive when traffic is light. 

Remember what Carlin said about speeders.

Now think about this for a bit; slow down you'll live longer.

Yeah, never quite got or understood the ""maniac"" part. I just assume they got somewhere to be. It doesn't offend my ego when someone passes me, which will almost always be on the left if I can help it (sometimes you do go into Lemming mode in the passing lane in very heavy traffic), but 99% of the time I'm yielding to faster traffic. I have hope their front bumper is more intimidating than mine to the guy in front impeding traffic (and hope they'll be a more aggressive tailgater too).

There are go-getters, and there are Lemmings. Go-Getters don't do Lemming well.

By the way, some commutes are pretty long for many people. I have 30 miles to cover, I could easily get a few miles ahead of you, especially if I caught one light you didn't before getting on the freeway. Yes, the chances of an accident in that short span are low, but they are possible. I've encountered bad wrecks where I was early enough on scene that traffic hadn't gone haywire yet, and law enforcement hadn't bottle-necked the situation even worse yet. So while I was only slowed down 2 or 3 minutes at most, the people 3 miles back might be slowed down 10 times more.

I'd give this slow guy a pass if his target was the next exit. It's safer for him (and rest of us, too) to limp for a few miles and get off at a controlled access point (if he can) than stop altogether at a random location. On the other hand, the ""immortal"", who makes no mistakes, driving and weaving at 20 mph higher, convinced that normal rules of traffic and laws of physics don't apply to him, is the one that is more dangerous, as he/she will do it for miles and miles with no intention to let up.

Actually, the Solomon curve goes parabolically higher and steeper on the slower side than the faster side (slightly). And in fact, going slightly over the average flow is the bottom of the curve, not zero.

Lastly, weaving is a symptom of a disease. That disease is left lane camping. Eradicating left lane camping makes weaving extinct, among many other undesirable behaviors.

Speed differential hazards are almost wiped out if you have lane discipline and strict adherence to passing laws. The reason speed differentials are so hazardous in the USA is because of our poor adherence to lane laws as a group of people.

Actually, the main causes of wrecks are summed up by the following:

1) Distraction
2) Drowsiness
3) Drunkenness

Get rid of those 3 things and Utopia is almost achieved. Number 4 is likely left lane camping, which #1 is certainly a partial, but not full cause of left lane camping. I firmly believe the ""oblivious acting"" is just that, an act, by a passive-aggressive hall monitor type.

You are right, stick.  Being 2500 miles from those you love is a terrible situation.  Doctor won’t let me fly since I developed a blood clot in my left knee area 10 years ago.  So, I have to wait for summer to see them.

Checked American Airlines and it will cost about $1000 round trip for both of them.  Once my son selects the flights, I’ll give him my credit card number.  I always pick up the cost of the trip since he has to support 2 boys, one of which starts college in 5 weeks.

If only I could fly things would be so much simpler. I missed my grandchildren growing up, although I did see my oldest grandson a couple of times a year from the week he was born until 2008 when I had to stop flying.  Doctor said it has to do with the high pressure in the plane’s cabin coupled with sitting in one place for 3+ hours each leg of the trip.  It is what it is!

How would you like to see your poster buddy and his wife?

I say that is a real bargain especially considering that Mrs. j can cook you up some tasty meals during that period and if you're nice to me I could bring along a bottle of my favorite car wax so that when I have finished doing your car it will be the envy of your complex.
